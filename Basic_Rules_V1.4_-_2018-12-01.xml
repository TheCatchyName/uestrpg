   <p>CONTENTS</p>
   <p/>
   <p/>
   <p/>
   <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
   <sect1 id="Section3">
      <p>Tamriel is a world filled with exciting stories. Many tales have been experienced and shared, but there are many more waiting to be told.</p>
      <p>The Elder Scrolls series was initially influenced by pen-and-paper role playing games. Arena's success came from its innovative RPG elements, and Daggerfall's character creation was completely reminiscent of popular pen-and-paper games. It is surprising that this immersive world was never officially released as a table top game. </p>
      <p>This book contains many customizations to the Dungeons &amp; Dragons rule sets to let you create intricate characters that are well suited for adventuring in Tamriel. This conversion project maintains many elements from D&amp;D Fifth Edition, and assumes that the players and the Dungeon Master  have a basic understanding of the game. Although it is a very similar conversion, there are some differences. Each of the classes, races, and backgrounds have been tailored to suit Tamriel, including some attributes, and birthsigns have been added to character creation.</p>
      <p>Birthsigns include powerful features that characters gain access to, which makes them slightly more capable at 1st level than with characters built from the standard Player's Handbook. These strengths help reduce the untimely deaths that can surprise low level parties, but this should be considered when creating appropriate challenges for the player characters.</p>
      <p>Each of the revisions in this book should be reviewed before playing, but many of these changes can be easily converted to or from standard D&amp;D features. Take as many changes as you feel comfortable with into your game. Remember, the only right way to play is by having fun.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PLAYING THE GAME</p>
      <p>In the game, each player creates an adventurer (also called a character) and teams up with other adventurers (played by friends). Working together, the group might explore a dark dungeon, a ruined city, a haunted castle, a lost temple deep in a jungle, or a lava-filled cavern beneath a mysterious mountain. The adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle fantastic monsters, and discover fabulous magic items and other treasure.</p>
      <p>One player, however, takes on the role of the Dungeon Master (DM), the game’s lead storyteller and referee. The DM creates adventures for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The DM might describe the entrance to Castle Volkihar, and the players decide what they want their adventurers to do. Will they walk across the dangerously weathered bridge? Tie themselves together with rope to minimize the chance that someone will fall if the bridge gives way? Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm?</p>
      <p>Then the DM determines the results of the adventurers’ actions and narrates what they experience. Because the DM can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, D&amp;D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can be exciting and unexpected.</p>
      <p>The game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a campaign. Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends every week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The adventurers grow in might as the campaign continues. Each monster defeated, each adventure completed, and each treasure recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also earns the adventurers new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by an adventurer’s level.</p>
      <p>There’s no winning and losing in the game—at least, not the way those terms are usually understood. Together, the DM and the players create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront deadly perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in by a nefarious villain. Even so, the other adventurers can search for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade, or the player might choose to create a new character to carry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created a memorable story, they all win.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>PLACES FOR ADVENTURE</p>
      <p>Nirn is a world filled with magic and monsters, brave warriors and spectacular adventures. The universe is built upon medieval fantasy with unique creatures, places, and magic that truly sets this world apart.</p>
      <p>Tamriel exists within a vast cosmos called the Aurbis. This universe encompasses the Void and all the Planes of Existence, such as Coldharbour, the realm of Molag Bal, and the plane of Akatosh. Within this universe are many planes that have yet to be explored, and of course, Nirn, the world where each of  the Elder Scrolls stories have taken place. </p>
      <p>On Nirn itself, Tamriel has been the only continent ever explored in the main series, with several provinces still to be seen, along with many other continents to create new epic stories. Each of these provinces and continents share characteristics, but each is set apart by its own histories and cultures, distinctive monsters and races, fantastic geography, ancient dungeons, and scheming villains. Each of the races have unusual traits in their different settings. The ancient tribal Bosmer of Valenwood, for example, are jungle dwelling cannibals, while many Redguards of Hammerfell are desert nomads. Some of the worlds feature more obscure races, such as the golden-clad Auroran's of Meridia's realm, or the Tsaesci, vampiric serpent-folk of Akavir. </p>
      <p>Your DM might set the campaign on one or more of these provinces, continents, and worlds. Because there is so much diversity among these places, you should check with your DM about any house rules that will affect your play of the game. Ultimately, the Dungeon Master is the authority on the campaign and its setting, no matter where or when they choose.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>USING THESE RULES</p>
      <p>The UESTRPG Basic Rules document is divided into</p>
      <p>three parts.</p>
      <p>Part 1 is about creating a character, providing the rules and guidance you need to make the character you’ll play in the game. It includes information on the various races, classes, backgrounds, equipment, and other customization options that you can choose from. Many of the rules in part 1 rely on material in parts 2 and 3.</p>
      <p>Part 2 details the rules of how to play the game, beyond the basics described in this introduction. That part covers the kinds of die rolls you make to determine success or failure at the tasks your character attempts, and describes the three broad categories of activity in the game: exploration, interaction, and combat.</p>
      <p>Part 3 is all about magic. It covers the nature of magic in the world of the Elder Scrolls, the rules for spellcasting, and a selection of typical spells available to magic-using characters (and monsters) in the game.</p>

      <p/>
      <p>HOW TO PLAY</p>
      <p>The play of the game unfolds according to this basic pattern.</p>
      <p>1. The DM describes the environment. The DM tells the players where their adventurers are and what’s around them, presenting the basic scope of options that present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room, what’s on a table, who’s in the tavern, and so on).</p>
      <p>2. The players describe what they want to do. Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, “We’ll take the east door,” for example. Other times, different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines an esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. The players don’t need to take turns, but the DM listens to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM might just say that the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the DM decides what happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.</p>
      <p>3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers’ actions. Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.</p>
      <p>This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cautiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or locked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon. In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is more structured and the players (and DM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the adventure.</p>
      <p>Often the action of an adventure takes place in the imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM’s verbal descriptions to set the scene. Some DMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other characters they play in the game. Sometimes, a DM might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures to represent each creature involved in a scene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.</p>

   <p>PART 1: CREATING A CHARACTER</p>
   <p>CHAPTER 1: STEP-BY-STEP CHARACTERS</p>
   <sect1 id="Section4">
      <p>Your first step in playing an adventurer in an Elder Scrolls game is to imagine and create a character of your own. Your character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You choose a race (such as Nord or Dunmer) and a class (such as warrior or mage). You also invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of your character. Once completed, your character serves as your representative in the game, your avatar in the  world.</p>
      <p>Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the kind of adventurer you want to play. You might be a courageous warrior, a skulking rogue, a fervent crusader, or a flamboyant sorcerer. Or you might be more interested in an unconventional character, such as a brawny rogue who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who picks off enemies from afar. Do you like fantasy fiction featuring beasts or elves? Try building a character of one of those races. Do you want your character to be the toughest adventurer at the table? Consider the warrior class. If you don’t know where else to begin, take a look at the illustrations in this book to see what catches your interest. </p>
      <p>Once you have a character in mind, follow these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character you want. Your conception of your character might evolve with each choice you make. What’s important is that you come to the table with a character you’re excited to play. </p>
      <p>Throughout this chapter, we use the term character sheet to mean whatever you use to track your character, whether it’s a formal character sheet, some form of digital record, or a piece of notebook paper. An official UESTRPG character sheet is a fine place to start until you know what information you need and how you use it during the game. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>BUILDING MALLIUS MERCIUS</p>
      <p>Each step of character creation includes an example of that step, with a player named James building his Imperial character, Mallius Mercius.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>1. CHOOSE A RACE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Each character has a race that it belongs to, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the Elder Scrolls world. Some races, such as Khajiit, also have subraces. Chapter 2 provides more information about these races. You can also read more about the races on many Elder Scrolls fan sites, in game books, and collections of these books that can be purchased from Bethesda or your favorite book supplier.</p>
      <p>The race you choose contributes to your character's identity in an important way, by establishing a general appearance and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character's race grants particular racial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor spells. These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For example, the racial traits of khajiit make them exceptional rogues, and high elves tend to be powerful mages. Sometimes playing against type can be fun, too. Orc sorcerers and Argonian crusaders, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters.</p>
      <p>Your race also increases one ore more of your ability scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these increases and remember to apply them later.</p>
      <p>Record the traits granted by your race on your character sheet. Be sure to note your starting languages and your base speed as well.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>BUILDING MALLIUS MERCIUS, STEP 1</p>
      <p>James is sitting down to create his character. He decides that a confident Imperial fits the character he wants to play. He notes all the racial traits of Imperials on his character sheet, including his speed of 30 feet and the languages he knows: Tamrielic, Altmeris, and Nordic.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>2. CHOOSE A CLASS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Every adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly describes the character's vocation, what special talents they possess, and the tactics they are most likely to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, or engaging in a tense negotiation. The character classes are described in chapter 3.</p>
      <p>Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are class features—capabilities (including spellcasting) that set your character apart from members of other classes. You also gain a number of proficiencies: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of the things your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.</p>
      <p>On your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level. </p>
      <p>Many of the classes in the UESTRPG game take their inspiration from the traditional classes of early Elder Scrolls games, such as Daggerfall and Morrowind.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>LEVEL</p>
      <p>Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring and gaining experience points (XP). A 1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring world, although they might have been a soldier or a pirate and done dangerous things before.</p>
      <p>Starting off at 1st level marks your character’s entry into the adventuring life. If you’re already familiar with the game, or if you are joining an existing campaign, your DM might decide to have you begin at a higher level, on the assumption that your character has already survived a few harrowing adventures. </p>
      <p>Record your level on your character sheet. If you’re starting at a higher level, record the additional elements your class gives you for your levels past 1st. Also record your experience points. A 1st-level character has 0 XP. A higher-level character typically begins with the minimum amount of XP required to reach that level (see “Beyond 1st Level” in the Player's Handbook).</p>
      <p/>
      <p>HIT POINTS AND HIT DICE</p>
      <p>Your character’s hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).</p>
      <p>At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your class. You start with hit points equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class description. (You also add your Endurance modifier, which you’ll determine in step 3.) This is also your hit point maximum.</p>
      <p>Record your character’s hit points on your character sheet. Also record the type of Hit Die your character uses and the number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see “Resting” in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook).</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PROFICIENCY BONUS</p>
      <p>The table that appears in your class description shows your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st- level character. Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you’ll be recording on your character sheet:</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>Attack rolls using weapons you’re proficient with</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>Attack rolls with spells you cast</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>Attribute checks using skills you’re proficient in</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>Attribute checks using tools you’re proficient with</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>Saving throws you’re proficient in</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each spellcasting class)</p>
         </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <p>Your class determines your weapon proficiencies, your saving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill and tool proficiencies. (Skills are described in chapter 7, tools in chapter 5.) Your background gives you additional skill and tool proficiencies, and some races give you more proficiencies. Be sure to note all of these proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.</p>
      <p>Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll or that it should be multiplied more than once, you nevertheless add it only once, multiply it only once, and halve it only once.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>BUILDING MALLIUS MERCIUS, STEP 2</p>
      <p>James imagines Mallius as a spellcaster in the Imperial Legion. He makes Mallius a spellsword and notes the spellsword's proficiencies and 1st-level class features on his character sheet.</p>
      <p>As a 1st-level spellsword, Mallius has 1 Hit Die – a d8 – and starts with hit points equal to 8 + his Endurance modifier. James notes this, and will record the final number after he determines Mallius' Endurance score (see step 3). James also notes the proficiency bonus for a 1st-level character, which is +2.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>3. DETERMINE ATTRIBUTE SCORES</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Much of what your character does in the game depends on his or her six attributes: Strength, Agility, Endurance, Intelligence, Willpower, and Personality. Each attribute has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.</p>
      <p>The six attributes and their use in the game are described in chapter 7. The Attribute Score Summary table provides a quick reference for what qualities are measured by each attribute, what races increases which attributes, and what classes consider each ability particularly important. </p>
      <p>You generate your character’s six attribute scores randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five more times, so that you have six numbers. If you want to save time or don’t like the idea of randomly determining attribute scores, you can use the following scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.</p>
      <p>Now take your six numbers and write each number beside one of your character’s six attributes to assign scores to Strength, Agility, Endurance, Intelligence, Willpower, and Personality. Afterward, make any changes to your attribute scores as a result of your race choice.</p>
      <p>After assigning your attribute scores, determine your attribute modifiers using the Attribute Scores and Modifiers table. To determine an attribute modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the attribute score and then divide the result by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each of your scores.</p>
      <p/>

      </informaltable>
      <p/>
      <p>BUILDING MALLIUS MERCIUS, STEP 3</p>
      <p>James decides to use the standard set of scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) for Mallius' attributes. Since he’s a spellsword, he puts his highest score, 15, in Strength. His next highest, 14, goes into Intelligence. Mallius might be a defensive battlemage, but James decides he wants the Imperial to be older, hardy, and a good leader, so he puts decent scores in Endurance and Personality. After applying his racial benefits (increasing Mallius' Personality by 2 and his Strength by 1), Mallius' attribute scores and modifiers look like this: Strength 16 (+2), Agility 10 (+0), Endurance 13 (+1), Intelligence 14 (+2), Willpower 8 (-1), Personality 14 (+2).</p>

      <p>4. CHOOSE A BACKGROUND</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Once you know the basic game aspects of your character, it’s time to flesh them out as a person. Your character needs a name. Spend a few minutes thinking about what they look like and how they behave in general terms. </p>
      <p>Using the information in chapter 4, you can flesh out your character’s physical appearance and personality traits. Choose your character’s alignment (the moral compass that guides his or her decisions) and ideals. Chapter 4 also helps you identify the things your character holds most dear, called bonds, and the flaws that could one day undermine them.</p>
      <p>Your character’s background describes where they came from, their original occupation, and the character’s place in the world. Your DM might offer additional backgrounds beyond the ones included in chapter 4, and might be willing to work with you to craft a background that’s a more precise fit for your character concept.</p>
      <p>A background gives your character a background feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills, and it might also give you additional languages or proficiency with certain kinds of tools. Record this information, along with the personality information you develop, on your character sheet. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>YOUR CHARACTER’S ABILITIES</p>
      <p>Take your character’s attribute scores and race into account as you flesh out their appearance and personality. A very strong character with low Intelligence might think and behave very differently from a very smart character with low Strength.</p>
      <p>For example, high Strength usually corresponds with a burly or athletic body, while a character with low Strength might be scrawny or plump. </p>
      <p>A character with high Agility is probably lithe and slim, while a character with low Agility might be either gangly and awkward or heavy and thick- fingered.</p>
      <p>A character with high Endurance usually looks healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A character with low Endurance might be sickly or frail. </p>
      <p>A character with high Intelligence might be highly inquisitive and studious, while a character with low Intelligence might speak simply or easily forget details. </p>
      <p>A character with high Willpower has good judgment, empathy, and a general awareness of what’s going on. A character with low Willpower might be absentminded, foolhardy, or oblivious. </p>
      <p>A character with high Personality exudes confidence, which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating presence. A character with a low Personality might come across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>YOUR CHARACTER'S BIRTHSIGN</p>
      <p>Each character on Nirn is born under a certain astrological birthsign. There are groups of stars that have been divided into thirteen constellations, twelve of which coincide with the months of the Tamrielic year. The thirteenth constellation, the Serpent, travels around the sky, threatening the other signs. </p>
      <p>Three of these constellations are known as Major Constellations, or Guardians. These Guardians, the Mage, the Warrior, and the Thief, protect the other constellations, known as charges, from the Serpent. </p>
      <p>A character's birthsign provides a powerful feature, such as a daily power or a constant benefit, but sometimes they can also bestow a curse.</p>
      <p>There are several ways for a player to choose their Birthsign, which can help build on their character concept or can help kick start ideas.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>BUILDING MALLIUS MERCIUS, STEP 4</p>
      <p>James fills in some of Mallius' basic details: his name, his sex (male), his height and weight, and his alignment (lawful good). His high Strength and Intelligence suggest a healthy, athletic body, and his low Willpower suggests a degree of forgetfulness. </p>
      <p>James decides that Mallius comes from a military family, never having a chance to know his father, who was killed at a young age. He grew up in the Imperial City, training to become a soldier of the Imperial Legion – so James chooses the soldier background. He notes the proficiencies and special feature this background gives him.</p>
      <p>James has a pretty clear picture of Mallius' personality in mind, so he skips the personality traits suggested in the soldier background, noting instead that Mallius is an overconfident man who loves to tell stories about his past victories, but he hides the fact that his history of war has made him cautious to grow close to anyone. He chooses the ideal of greater good from the list in his background, noting that Mallius believes that it is his responsibility to protect others at all costs. </p>
      <p>Even though he his distant to his friends, Mallius' bond is to keep his allies safe and always fight by their side. His flaw is tied to his cautious nature – he is slow to trust others and can be dismissive of others who only want to help. </p>
      <p>For his Birthsign, James chose The Lady, one of the Warrior's Charges, which increases his Willpower to 15 and Endurance to 14.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>5. CHOOSE EQUIPMENT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Your class and background determine your character’s starting equipment, including weapons, armor, and other adventuring gear. Record this equipment on your character sheet. All such items are detailed in chapter 5, “Equipment.“ </p>
      <p>Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class and background, you can purchase your starting equipment. You have a number of septims (s), Tamriel's favored currency, to spend based on your class, as shown in chapter 5. Extensive lists of equipment, with prices, also appear in that chapter. If you wish, you can also have one trinket at no cost (see the Trinkets table at the end of chapter 5 in the Player's Handbook). </p>
      <p>Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can carry. Try not to purchase equipment with a total weight (in pounds) exceeding your Strength score times 15. Chapter 7 has more information on carrying capacity. </p>

                  <p>SEPTIMS, DRAKES, &amp; GOLD</p>
                  <p>The main currency in Tamriel is the Septim, named after Emperor Tiber Septim. This term is also interchangeable with gold, and drakes. Each of these terms represent the same value.</p>
               </entry>

      </informaltable>
      <p/>
      <p>ARMOR CLASS</p>
      <p>Your Armor Class (AC) represents how well your character avoids being wounded in battle. Things that contribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the shield you carry, and your Agility modifier. Not all characters wear armor or carry shields, however. </p>
      <p>Without armor or a shield, your character’s AC equals 10 + their Agility modifier. If your character wears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate your AC using the rules in chapter 5. Record your AC on your character sheet. </p>
      <p>Your character needs to be proficient with armor and shields to wear and use them effectively, and your armor and shield proficiencies are determined by your class. There are drawbacks to wearing armor or carrying a shield if you lack the required proficiency, as explained in chapter 5.</p>
      <p>Some spells and class features give you a different way to calculate your AC. If you have multiple features that give you different ways to calculate your AC, you choose which one to use.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>WEAPONS</p>
      <p>For each weapon your character wields, calculate the modifier you use when you attack with the weapon and the damage you deal when you hit.</p>
      <p>When you make an attack with a weapon, you roll a d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if you are proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate ability modifier. </p>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>For attacks with melee weapons, use your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the finesse property, such as a rapier, can use your Agility modifier instead.</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>For attacks with ranged weapons, use your Agility modifier for attack and damage rolls. A melee weapon that has the thrown property, such as a handaxe, can use your Strength modifier instead.</p>
         </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <p/>
      <p>BUILDING MALLIUS MERCIUS, STEP 5</p>
      <p>James writes down the starting equipment from the spellsword class and the soldier background. His starting equipment includes scale mail, which give Mallius an Armor Class of 14.</p>
      <p>For Mallius' weapons, James chooses a longsword and a hand crossbow. His longsword is a melee weapon, so Mallius uses his Strength modifier for his attacks and damage. His attack bonus is his Strength modifier (+2) plus his proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +4. The longsword deals 1d8 slashing damage, and Mallius adds his Strength modifier to the damage when he hits, for a total of 1d8 + 2 slashing damage. When firing his hand crossbow, Mallius uses his Agility modifier for his attacks and damage. His attack bonus is his Agility modifier (0) plus his proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +2. The hand crossbow deals 1d6 piercing damage, and adds Mallius' Agility modifier, which is 0.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>6. COME TOGETHER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Most heroic characters don’t work alone. Each character plays a role within a party, a group of adventurers working together for a common purpose. Teamwork and cooperation greatly improve your party’s chances to survive the many perils in the world of Tamriel. Talk to your fellow players and your DM to decide whether your characters know one another, how they met,</p>

   <p>CHAPTER 2: RACES</p>
   <sect1 id="Section5">
      <p>A visit to one of the great cities in Tamriel – Imperial City, Solitude, or Alinor – overwhelms the senses. Voices chatter in countless different languages. The smells of cooking in dozens of different cuisines mingle with the odors of crowded streets and poor sanitation. Buildings in a myriad of architectural styles display the diverse origins of their inhabitants.</p>
      <p>And the people themselves – people of varying size, shape, and color, dressed in a dazzling spectrum of styles and hues – represent many different races, from the diminutive Bosmer, to the majestic Altmer, mingling among a group of Imperial nobles. </p>
      <p>Scattered among the elves and humans are some of the less common races; a hulking Orc here, pushing his way through the crowd, and a sly Khajiit there, lurking in the shadows with mischief in her eyes. A group of Argonians gather around a strange tree in silence.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CHOOSING A RACE</p>
      <p>Each of the provinces are a home to one of the common races of Tamriel. Humans make up the majority of Cyrodiil, Hammerfell, High Rock, and Skyrim, while the elves populate Morrowind, the Summerset Isles, and Valenwood. Khajiit call Elsweyr home, and the argonians are comfortable in the Black Marsh. Your character belongs to one of these peoples. Although each race has an ancestral heritage to a specific province, it is very common for the races to intermingle and travel abroad. </p>
      <p>Not every intelligent race of Tamriel is appropriate for a player-controlled adventurer. humans, elves, khajiit, and argonians are the most common races to produce the sort of adventurers who make up typical parties. Other races and subraces are less common as adventurers.</p>
      <p>Your choice of race affects many different aspects of your character. It establishes fundamental qualities that exist throughout your character’s adventuring career. When making this decision, keep in mind the kind of character you want to play. For example, a khajiit could be a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a nord makes a tough warrior, and an altmer can be a master of arcane magic. </p>
      <p>Your character race not only affects your attribute scores and traits but also provides the cues for building your character’s story. Each race’s description in this chapter includes information to help you roleplay a character of that race, including personality, physical appearance, features of society, and racial alignment tendencies. These details are suggestions to help you think about your character; adventurers can deviate widely from the norm for their race. It’s worthwhile to consider why your character is different, as a helpful way to think about your character’s background and personality.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>RACIAL TRAITS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to members of that race. The following entries appear among the traits of most races. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>ABILITY SCORE INCREASE</p>
      <p>Every race increases one or more of a character’s ability scores.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>AGE</p>
      <p>The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race’s expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your attribute scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Endurance score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Willpower. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>ALIGNMENT</p>
      <p>Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your khajiit is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful khajiit society can help you better define your character. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>SIZE</p>
      <p>Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in chapter 5.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SPEED</p>
      <p>Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (chapter 8) and fighting (chapter 9). </p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>LANGUAGES</p>
      <p>By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages. Chapter 4 lists the  most common languages of Tamriel.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SUBRACES</p>
      <p>Some races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace. Relationships among subraces vary significantly from race to race. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>ALTMER (HIGH ELF)</p>
      <p>Altmer are proud and graceful people who consider themselves to be the highest echelon of society. Their cities celebrate an enlightened culture filled with a love for art, magic, music, and beauty. They are known as High Elves to the human races, which altmer consider an adage to their culture, while humans understand it to mean proud or snobbish.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SLENDER AND GRACEFUL</p>
      <p>
         <p/>With their elegant stature and beauty, high elves typically have healthy gaunt features. They are the tallest of all the races, usually well over 6 feet tall and sometimes above 7 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing between 140 and 180 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females. </p>
      <p>Altmer have physical colorations that are very homogeneous in their nature. Their golden skin ranges from pale yellow tones to bronze, while their hair and eyes comes in similar shades, which sometimes makes it difficult to distinguish from long distances. Their hair colour ranges from nearly white to  blonde, to golden brown, while their almond shaped eyes are like pools of liquid gold. Altmer rarely have facial hair, either from genetics or from their favored cultured aesthetic. They favor elegant clothing and jewelry, usually in fabrics and materials that compliment their natural appearance.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>A TIMELESS PERSPECTIVE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Altmer, much like the other elves, can live for exceptional lengths of time, usually of spans two to three times as long as humans. An elf is considered old at 300 years of age, and typically reaches 400 years. Their natural resistance to disease allows them to live longer than the other races. It is even rumored that there are elves well over 4,000 year old, extending their lifespans by avoiding violence or mastering powerful restorative magic. </p>
      <p>Their extended lifespan allows altmer to consider time as a luxury, mastering skills over long periods of research that their human counterparts would never be able to fathom. Societies of altmer have been known to avoid war and violence, choosing to study their enemies, confident that they can easily wait for the most opportune time to strike quickly, or simply just outlive their nuisance. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>DIVINE DESCENDANTS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Altmer consider themselves to be the most direct descendants of the original Aldmer elves, the first elves of the Merethic Era. The altmer believe that they resemble their aldmer ancestors and take great pride in keeping a pure lineage, striving to emulate their ways with great reverence.</p>
      <p>Most altmer live in beautifully appointed cities and towns that are populated mostly with other altmer. Their architecture is strong and graceful, with pointed steeples to emphasize height, proudly reaching upwards towards the heavens. Truly, an visual echo to the High Elves themselves. Altmer are talented artisans, utilizing their long lifespans and mythic ancestry to hone their sophisticated crafts.</p>
      <p>Their societies are strongly regimented with deep discipline and are septed by a rigid hierarchy of classes. Teachers and priests are regarded as the highest rank, followed by artists, princes, warriors, landowners, merchants, workers, and finally their slaves.</p>
      <p>Outside of the Summerset Isles, the homeland of the altmer, they are commonly scholars, artists, or sages. Human nobles compete for the services of altmer to become court wizards, or as instructors of magic.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>EXPLORATION AND ADVENTURE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Altmer that take up a life of adventure usually do so for the sake of discovery and exploration. Always curious and passionate for a deeper understanding of their interests, altmer will commonly seek out careers that allow them to travel and study at their own pace. Naturally the most magically-inclined races of Tamriel, they enjoy gaining greater power, which adventuring allows them to do. Some might join with rebels fighting for social reform, while others might join militant groups that champion their moral cause.</p>

      <p/>
      <p>ARGONIAN</p>
      <p>Argonians, also known as People of the Root, or Saxhleel in their native tongue of Jel, are the reptilian natives of the swampland known as the Black Marsh. The other races of Tamriel sometimes refer to them as 'lizards' or the 'Lizard Folk', which can be considered derogative.  Argonians possess the most alien personalities in all of  Tamriel, perceived by other races as to have no personality nor emotions.</p>
      <p>Outside of argonia, little is known of their homeland or native culture, and their alien physiology and customs are not well understood by scholars. They have been perhaps the most misunderstood of all the intelligent races. </p>
      <p>Despite their alien outlook, some argonians make an effort to understand and, in their own manner, befriend people of other races. Such argonians make faithful and skilled allies.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ALIEN ANCESTRY</p>
      <p>
         <p/>The argonian's reptilian nature comes through not only in their appearance, but also in how they think and act. The other races mistake them to be cold and calculating, but that is mostly because their physiology lacks the ability to express emotions in a noticeable way to non-argonians. They are, however, capable of displaying aggression and fear in an obvious manner by narrowing their eyes or showing their teeth.</p>
      <p>Although their physical appearance is reptilian, they are much more amphibious in reality. They have small gills behind their ears, instinctively swim in a the same style as an eel, and are capable of growing feathers. Their females have mammalian breasts, although they lay eggs. Even their genders are confusing to humans and elves. It is rumored that an argonian can change it's sex in a time of need.</p>
      <p>They owe their strange lifestyles to their connection to the Hist, a sentient tree that is believed to be one of the original lifeforms of Tamriel. Most argonians are born with a connection to the hist, able to feel their presence in their minds at all time. It is said that an argonian that is connected to the Hist have unique souls that set them apart from men and mer.  Argonians born without this connection are looked at as disadvantaged by other argonians.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CAUTIOUS AND LOYAL</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Because they are hard to understand, humans and elves treat argonians as cold-blooded in nature. Although this is physically true, argonians create deep and long lasting bonds with their own people and allies. Part of this misunderstanding is in part attributed to their emotionless demeanor, which makes them nearly impossible to get to know. They are also notoriously slow to trust outsiders. </p>
      <p>At their core, argonians are fiercely loyal allies, making the difficulty of learning their ways and getting to know their tribes well worth the effort. Allied argonians will fight to the death to protect anyone they deem to be family or friend.</p>
      <p>A remarkable trait of the argonians is their ability as a culture to forgive and forget quickly. The many tribes of the Black Marsh believe that hating each other in to hate themselves, as they are all People of the Root. They believe that it is better to forget and move on, not dwelling on the past or the future, and simply focus on the present.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DISTRUSTFUL AND ISOLATIONIST</p>
      <p>
         <p/>History has not always been kind to the argonian people. The ancient Chimer of Morrowind first utilized the Lizard Folk as slaves centuries before their Dunmer ancestors would do the same. Imperial forces have made several attempts to break through the thick swamps and jungles of the Black Marsh and had set up bases around the coastlines, essentially annexing their culture from the rest of Tamriel.</p>
      <p>Over time, the argonians fought back, largely through the use of guerrilla warfare, defending their borders across countless centuries. In recent years, they have broke free from their slavers and have claimed independence from the Empire.</p>

                  <p>ARGONIAN SPEECH</p>
                  <p>Argonian can master Common, but their mindset results in a speech pattern distinct from other humanoids. </p>
                  <p>Argonians rarely use inflection in their speech, which can make their meaning difficult to interpret. </p>
                  <p>Names confuse them, unless they are descriptive. They tend to apply their own naming conventions to other creatures using Common words. </p>
                  <p>Argonians use active verbs to describe the world. An argonian in cold weather might say, “This wind brings cold” rather than “I feel cold.” Argonians tend to define things in terms of actions, rather than effects.</p>

      <p>BOSMER (WOOD ELF)</p>
      <p>Bosmer are the Elven clan-folk from the forests of Valenwood. Known as Wood Elves among men, the Bosmer spend their days in harmony with nature and appreciate the wild beauty of the lands and it's creatures. This lifestyle lends themselves to become notable archers and scouts.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>MODEST AND NIMBLE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Bosmer are one of the smallest races on Tamriel. They average around 5 feet tall and weigh between 100 and 130 pounds. This small frame grants the bosmer a natural proclivity for moving nimbly and stealthily. As with the other elves, they live two to three times as long as humans. Combined with their increased fertility and long lives, bosmer are known to have large families, and are one of the most populous races of Tamriel.</p>
      <p>Wood Elves, or Tree-Sap People, have skin tones in copper and bronze, and sometimes have traces of light green. Their hair tends toward browns and blacks, but occasionally red and copper colored. Their eyes are golden, brown, and sometimes solid black with no visible white.</p>

      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>TREATY OF FROND AND LEAF</p>
      <p>
         <p/>The ancestor's of the bosmer were some of the first to leave Old Ehlnofey, rejecting the formal traditions and high culture of the Aldmeri, instead preferring romantic ideas and a simple existence. They traveled to Valenwood to settle in the wild and untamed forests. Having to fight against lush jungles and savage creatures influenced the evolution of their society to make them who they are to this day.</p>
      <p>It is said that the bosmer made a deal with Y'ffre, the God of Song and Forest, called the Green Pact. With this treaty,  the Green would aid the bosmer, providing them with shelter and safe passage, and in exchange, the bosmer are forbidden from destruction of the forests. This brings great challenges that the bosmer of Valenwood have adhered to for centuries. They are forbidden from eating any of the vegetation, so their diet is strictly meat, including some delicacies, such as  beverages made from fermented pigs milk, called jagga, or fermented meat seasoned with insect organs, called rotmeth.</p>
      <p>The bosmer are also notable pacifists. They have never instigated any of the major wars of Tamriel and aim to keep peace between their tribes. This may have something to do with an ancient tradition from the Green Pact called the Meat Mandate, which required the bosmer to eat the bodies of their fallen enemies within three days. Before a great battle, the wood elves would prepare themselves by fasting. This cannibalistic ritual set the bosmer apart from the other races, but this practice diminished during the Second Era and is now only observed in remote tribal villages.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>HIDDEN WOODLAND REALMS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Most Wood Elves of Valenwood live in small villages hidden among the trees. Although the Green Pact prevents the bosmer from using lumber or hollowing out trees for shelter, they have been blessed with the ability to grow their shelter. Trees, branches, and vines weave together to suit the needs of the faithful. Bridges of vines and boughs knit as one, sometimes right before your eyes, to provide passage between homes and villages. </p>
      <p/>

      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>Bone, resin, and sinew are also used in building construction, as well as for their art and weapons. Totems made from skulls and bones decorate many residences, and hides stretched across frames of bone create partitions for privacy. Bosmer bows, made from horns and sinew, are noted as the best bows in Tamriel. In fact, it is rumored that the bow was invented by the bosmer. These superior weapons, along with hides and bone charms are the main exports to the neighboring nations.</p>
      <p>Many of the coastal villages, especially those founded by other races, are built on the forest floor, and are typically constructed from traditional construction materials, like timber and stone. The Green Pact allows bosmer to import timber to make their homes, and doesn't apply to the other races. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>SKILLED ADVENTURERS </p>
      <p>
         <p/>As some of the greatest hunters and scouts in all of Tamriel, many Bosmer leave their villages to seek out greater challenges. They are born warriors, excelling at martial combat, and they have a natural connection with beasts. </p>
      <p>Those that have ignored the Pact and turned their back on Y'ffre are expelled from their tribe. An exiled bosmer usually has no other option than to seek out adventure elsewhere.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>BOSMER NAMES</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Most bosmer have only their given name, but it is not unheard of to have a family name, which is typically descriptive of their skills or ancestry.</p>

      <p>Male Names: Aengvir, Athragar, Baenlin, Brenor, Calthindor, Deros, Drinlin, Elseer, Faenir, Fangaril, Filalmoth, Firras, Gelin, Hadran, Inluin, Lenor, Malgoth, Niden, Ording, Rollin, Saldir, Thranor, Urunil</p>

      <p>BRETON</p>
      <p>The manmer, or half elves, of High Rock are known as Bretons. They are the descendants of Aldmeri rulers and Nedic slaves, who eventually came to rule over the feudal society.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>
         <p/>COUPLED LINEAGE</p>
      <p>Bretons are sometimes referred to as the mongrel race of Tamriel, being neither elven, nor truly human. Sometimes, although usually only in a derogative manner, the Bretons are called Manmeri, literally 'man-elf', due to their history of crossbreeding.</p>
      <p>Their physical appearance is similar to their Nedic ancestors, giving them pale skin tones compble to their Nord and Imperial cousins, along with the same range of hair color. Similar to the high elves, they maintain a slender form. This elven bloodline ensures that they are never quite as muscular as the other human races. A keen observer can also notice subtle elven lineaments, especially from their eyebrows,  slightly pointed ears, and high cheekbones. Some bretons even seem to adopt their elven arrogance, but paired with their human emotions, it usually comes off more graceful.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CURIOUS AND INQUISITIVE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Although their Aldmeri ancestry is diluted, which shows in their physical appearance, they remain as capable mages with a strong resistance to magic. They are intellectual purists, known for their aptitude in abstract thinking, and are naturally drawn towards careers that favor logic and ordered complexity.</p>
      <p>Bretons are known to be skilled in many fields. Their friendly spirits and humorous demeanor lend themselves to writing, acting, and artistry. Their love of commerce leads them into banking, manufacturing, and trading, while their desire for order makes them well suited for the military and sailing.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>A STRUGGLE FOR SOVEREIGNTY</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Breton society is divided into the the many different regions of High Rock. The feudal kingdoms compete for power and enforce the strict hierarchy that splits its people from peasants and the elite. Despite this obvious rivalry, the bretons are united in their culture, accents, customs and language. Their villages are quaint, and although the architecture may change between the districts, they are usually functional in style and free of ornamentation. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>Bretons compete with the orsimer, with their great city of orsinium and the many small orcish strongholds, as well as the barbaric reachmen.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>BORN FOR ADVENTURE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Performing quests and services is a common way for bretons to rise in the ranks of their society, which has created a unique form of enthusiasm. The younger bretons are raised with a desire to find fortune and glory all over Tamriel.</p>

                  <p>Many Bretons learn at an early age to get along with everyone, defusing hostility and finding common ground. As a race, they have elven grace without elven aloofness and human energy without human boorishness. They often make excellent ambassadors and go-betweens.</p>

      <p>DUNMER (DARK ELF)</p>
      <p>Dunmer, or Dark Elves, are the daedric worshiping elves from the alien province of Morrowind. “Dark” is a term used not only for their darkened skin tone, but also from their ill-fated history and general cultural philosophies. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>SKIN OF TWILIGHT, EYES OF SUNLIGHT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>The ashen skinned elves are typically the same size and shape as the human races, which makes them shorter than their altmer cousins, but taller than the bosmer. Their skin tone ranges from green, to varying shades of grey, to light blue, and their red glowing eyes make their appearance exceptionally unique. More often than not, their hair is jet black, but it can range in color from white, to grey, shades of dark brown, and on rare occasions, dark red.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>A CURSE AS A REMINDER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Before the dark elves were known as they are today, they were called the Chimer, or People of the North. They were a dissident tribe of aldmeri who followed their prophet Veloth and worshiped the three 'good' daedra. They traveled to modern day Morrowind, where they warred with the Dwemer and Orcs.</p>
      <p>After the Battle of Red Mountain, the 'Living Gods' of the Tribunal betrayed their oath to Azura, which forever cursed them with skin as black as ash, and eyes red with fire. They were from then on known as the Dunmer.</p>
      <p>The Dunmer have always had a grim outlook, which may either be due to their unfortunate past, or perhaps a cause for it. They are generally disdainful, and distrusting of other races and those born outside of Morrowind, which they refer to as outlanders. Nationalistic and proud, the dunmer are also ruthless and cruel, but they are also exceptionally loyal and have strong family values maintained by ancestral worship. They are not quick to trust anyone who claims to be a friend, but once a dunmer gives someone their loyalty, the dunmer is a firm friend or ally for life.</p>
      <p>Another dark side of dunmer history is their extensive use of slavery. Mostly argonian and khajiit slaves were used, but so were men and mer in rare cases. Their vengeful nature and long history of ill repute prevents them from gaining significant influence with the other nations.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>BALANCED WARRIORS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Dunmer are exceptionally well rounded warriors. Notable for their powerful intellect, agile physique, and natural strength, dunmer are exceptional militants, mercenaries, and warriors. </p>
      <p>With the destruction of Vvardenfell and the argonian invasion, many dunmer have fled their homeland, trying to make their own way in the world. Their natural martial gifts and resilient heritage makes them strong survivors. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>DUNMER NAMES</p>

      <p>IMPERIAL</p>
      <p>Imperials are the well educated and civilized men of the cosmopolitan province of Cyrodiil. Although not as physically impressive as some of the other races, the Imperials have a confident authority about them that they have been able to use to their advantage with the surrounding nations. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>FROM SLAVE TO MASTER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>When the Imperial race emerged from the original Nibenese tribesman and the Nedic immigrants, they were subjugated by the Ayleids, or Wild Elves of Cyrodiil. They remained as slaves for decades before creating a rebellion that overthrew their elven masters, creating the first human empire. Although short lived, this early empire was disrupted through civil war, splitting Cyrodiil into two distinct cultures: the Eastern Nibenese and the Western Colovians. Since then, the Imperials and their ever changing Empire have had some part in the birth of each Era. </p>
      <p>DIPLOMATS AND SOLDIERS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Known for their impressive citizen armies, the Imperials are exceptionally disciplined and treat the law with the utmost respect. Banners of the Imperial Empire can be found in nearly every province of Tamriel, although recent years have proven to be a struggle to maintain their power.</p>
      <p>As shrewd diplomats and remarkable negotiators, the Imperials have had great success subduing other nations, bringing peace and prosperity to many societies. When their authority is questioned, their martial prowess and extraordinary organization of their military usually makes quick work of any dissenters. </p>
      <p/>

      <p>The Imperials that settled in the East, by the Nibenay, became the Nibenese. This area was brought together by the Alessian order and maintains strong merchant guilds. Nibenese are proud cosmopolitan people who maintain strong relationships with the other provinces through merchant guilds. They are more given to the studies of magic, philosophy, and the evolution of ancient tradition. Many outfit themselves in garish clothing, tattoos, and brandings. </p>
      <p>Attribute Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 1.</p>
      <p>Voice of the Emperor. You know the friends cantrip. Additionally, once between long rests, you are able to use this cantrip without your target knowing it was cast on them.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>KHAJIIT</p>
      <p>Hailing from the tropical province of Elsweyr, khajiit are feline humanoids, known for their grace and intellect. Nomadic and inquisitive, the khajiit rarely stay in one place for long.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CHILDREN OF THE MOON</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Bound to the lunar lattice, a mysterious force understood by the khajiit, the phases of the two moons at the time of their birth determines the form, or 'breed', a khajiit will assume. All newborns look alike, much smaller than the other races of Tamriel, but the early days of their life begin to give way to their future form. There are rumored to be more than twenty forms of khajiit, but most common are Alfiq, Cathay, Dagi, Ohmes, Pahmar, Senche, Suthay, and Tojay. The humanoid forms are described in further detail in  the subrace section.</p>
      <p>Khajiit differ greatly from all other races, most obviously with their catlike form, tail, fur, and digitigrade stance. Although typical of most humanoid khajiit, some sub-species, such as the ohmes, appear more similar to the bosmer than to their own brothers and sisters. Their physical appearance isn't their only physiological differences. Even the digestive systems and metabolisms are different from most other races, allowing them to have a stronger resilience to substances like moon sugar,</p>
      <p>Bright textiles and shiny objects are desired by khajiit. They dress in cloth shawls of brilliant colors, known as a budi, which helps defend themselves from the sun. They adorn themselves with sparkling jewelry and trinkets, and are known to wear flowers and herbs in their braided fur. The breeds that do not grow fur typically tattoo themselves with cultural or religious symbols to resemble their cousins.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>THE HOLY MOONS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>A large part of the khajiit religion is worship of the two moons of Tamriel. This is an obvious path, given how much the moons affect the lives of every khajiit. Another significant part of the khajiit lifestyle is the harvest and ingestion of a powerful and addictive substance called moon sugar. This substance is known  to be crystallized moonlight, which they believe by ingesting, they are absorbing a part of the eternal souls of the moon gods, Jone and Jode.</p>
      <p>When moon sugar is ingested, it causes fits of ecstasy and abandon. Paired with the highly addictive nature, it is common for khajiit settlements to be littered with cat-men shivering in the grips of sugar fits.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, moon-sugar is a daily part of khajiit life, and serves as their chief export. Their affection for moon-sugar has developed a sweet tooth, and the khajiit diet is invariably sweet. Candies, cakes, puddings, and sugared meats are staples in khajiit cuisine. This fare is usually laced with powdered moon-sugar, and the other races would be wise to never accept a sweet roll from a cat.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SOCIETAL DUALITY</p>
      <p>
         <p/>The societies of khajiit are lead by a unique breed of khajiit known as the Mane, born under the aligned moons. Tradition states that only one mane can be alive at a time and it is believed that each mane is a reincarnation of the previous.</p>
      <p>Khajiit civilizations are divided into two specific cultures. The jungles of Elsweyr are civil and are formed around an agrarian aristocracy, whereas the northern wastes and grasslands tend to be nomadic, pride-centric groups that contest for territory. </p>
      <p>GUARDIANS AND CHARLATANS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Khajiit, who are commonly targeted for racial discrimination, have had to deal with being kidnapped and sold into slavery. This harsh reality has made them take self defense very seriously. The majority of khajiit use their claws as weapons, and many have formed groups that utilize their natural gifts in various forms of martial arts. </p>
      <p>Other khajiit welcome the black market with open paws, taking to a life of piracy, smuggling moon sugar, and the more potent skooma, to the many different lands. Khajiit's natural abilities make them superb thieves and acrobats, as well as fearsome warriors.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>KHAJIIT NAMES</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Each Khajiit has a single name in their language, Ta'agra, but it is also common for a Khajiit to go by their Tamrielic name, usually given to them by men or mer. These common names are typically descriptive of the their personality or quirks.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Male Names: Akrah, Azbishan, Balag, Dazur, Eilun, Fa'alar, Ghadar, Hilan, Jahirr, Khasar, Lansur, Maniz, Malirzzaka, Nakkhu, Oblan, Pinar, Rakhad, Razur, Sabra, Tabil, Urjen, Vashpar, Yan,  Zaban, Zino</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Female Names: Abizah, Azum, Bakkhara, Bindu, Darali, Elamusa, Fedura, Hani, Inama, Kala, Kiasha, Manabi, Mura, Nayya, Pinirai, Samati, Sebazi, Shuzura, Tahara, Tohiba, Urbani, Vaifa, Yana, Zara, Zurka</p>
      <p>Tamrielic Names: Ashenfur, Black-Paw, Clevereyes, Dawnwalker, Dusty-Claw, Elf-Biter, Firebreath, Four-Toes, Iron-Ear, Kink Tail, Silvertongue, Soft-Fur, Sugar-Claws, Tender-Paws, Wet-Whiskers</p>
      <p/>
      <p>KHAJIIT HONORIFICS</p>
      <p>Khajiit often, but not always, have either a prefix or a suffix, or sometimes both, as part of their name, usually septed by an apostrophe. The titles are typically meant to represent a part of their personality or traits. Some Khajiit believe having both a prefix and a suffix is a sign of arrogance and pride.</p>

      <p>KHAJIIT TRAITS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Your Khajiit heritage manifests in a variety of traits you share with other khajiit. </p>
      <p>Attribute Score Increase. Your Agility score increases by 2.</p>
      <p>Age. Different Khajiit born under different cycles have significantly different life spans. They can range from 150 to 400 years, if not more.</p>
      <p>Alignment. Khajiit tend toward chaotic alignments, as they let impulse and fancy guide their decisions. They are rarely evil, except for those driven by greed or other dark impulses.</p>
      <p>Speed. Your base walking speed is 35 feet.</p>
      
      <p>Eye of Fear. You know how to use your cat-like eyes to demoralize others. You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.</p>
      <p>Eye of Night. Your khajiit ancestry grants you superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. </p>
      <p>Quick Claws. Because of your claws, you have a climbing speed of 20 feet. In addition, your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p>
      
      <p>Languages. You can speak, read, and write Tamrielic and Ta'agra. Ta'agra script combines unique and fluid motions. Artistic interpretation is praised and varies greatly between authors.</p>
      <p>Subrace. There are many subraces of the Khajiit. Many of the subraces are humanoid in shape, but there are others, such as the Alfiq, that more resemble a house cat, or the senche, which are tiger-like battle cats.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>OHMES &amp; OHMES RAHT</p>
      <p>The Ohmes generally look more similar to the Bosmer, although slightly smaller in stature, than they do to their feline brothers. Many Ohmes will paint or tattoo their faces to resemble their feline heritage. Unlike other Khajiit, they have no fur, no tail, or any other distinguishable Khajiit feature. </p>
      <p>Ohmes-raht have slightly larger builds than their ohmes cousins, usually similar in size and appearance of men, other than their short light fur and tails. Also similar to men, the Ohmes-raht walk on their heels as opposed to the balls of their feet like many other species of Khajiit.</p>
      <p>Attribute Score Increase. Your Personality score increases by 1.</p>
      <p>Size. Ohmes Khajiit are similar in size to the Bosmer, rarely taller than 5 feet tall, whereas Ohmes-raht range from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is medium. </p>
      <p>Ambassador. Your elven-like form makes you a natural ambassador to the other races. You gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills. If you're already proficient in either skill, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any check you make with that skill. </p>
      <p>Ohmes Combat Training. The Ohmes do not have natural claws, like their Khajiit brethren, and do not benefit from the Quick Claws trait. Instead, they are proficient in Hand-to-Hand and Short Blade weapons to make up for their natural handicap.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>
         <anchor id="Suthay"/>SUTHAY &amp; SUTHAY-RAHT</p>
      <p>While they are similar in height to the Ohmes, that is mostly where the similarities end. The Suthay are much more cat like in appearance with their high set ears and feline facial features, along with a long tail and digitigrade legs.</p>
      <p>Suthay-raht are nearly the same as the Suthay in all their features except their stature closer resembles the height of men. The Suthay-raht are the most common breed of Khajiit outside of Elsweyr.</p>
      <p>Attribute Score Increase. Your Endurance score increases by 1. </p>
      <p>Size. Suthay Khajiit are similar in size to the Ohmes, rarely taller than 5 feet tall. Suthay-raht range from 5 feet to 6 feet tall. Your size is medium.</p>
      <p>Natural Bandit. You are able to use your claws as thieves' tools. You can add your proficiency modifier to any check using your claws in this way, even if you are not proficient in thieves' tools.</p>
      <p>Feline Agility. Your reflexes and agility allow you to move with a burst of speed. When you move on your turn in combat, you can double your speed until the end of the turn. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you move 0 feet on one of your turns.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CATHAY &amp; CATHAY-RAHT</p>
      <p>Similar to the Suthay-raht in appearance and bi-pedalism, however they possess greater stature and strength.</p>
      <p>Cathay-raht are larger and more powerful and are often described as "jaguar-men".</p>
      <p>Attribute Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 1. </p>
      <p>Size. Cathay Khajiit are similar in size to most men and range from 5 feet to 6 ½ feet. Your size is medium.</p>
      <p>Powerful Build. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. </p>
      <p>Savage Attacks. When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>
         <anchor id="Dagi"/>DAGI &amp; DAGI-RAHT</p>
      <p>Dagi live in the trees of the Tenmar forest. Due to their smaller size and light weight, they are able to dwell in the higher branches which even the Bosmer cannot reach. The Dagi have a natural affinity for magic, and are known spellcasters, a characteristic often taken advantage of in Khajiiti battle-tactics.</p>
      <p>The Dagi-raht are similar in all respects, while their size is somewhat larger.</p>
      <p>Size. Dagi and Dagi-raht average about 3 to 4 feet tall and weigh around 40 pounds. Your Size is small.</p>
      <p>Attribute Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 1.</p>
      <p>Natural Magic. You know the Thaumaturgy cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the Witch Bolt spell as a 2nd level spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the Darkness spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>NORD</p>
      <p>Children of the Sky, Nords are the tall and hardy humans from the northern province of Skyrim. The harsh environments of Skyrim have hardened Nords. Even those who have been born in easier civilizations have this ingrained toughness. You will most likely find Nords working in fields that prove their robustness. A good nord knows the value of hard work. The second most likely place to find a nord is inside the local watering hole. Mead and music go hand in hand with nordic culture. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>STONG WILLED AND STRONG ARMED</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Nords are the tallest of the human races and have fair skin and fair colored hair. They are known for their powerful physique and modest intellect. </p>
      <p>Nords are fierce competitors and strongly believe in fighting for status and for sport. Favoring brute strength over wit, the nords are suspicious of mages and don't believe in using social status or wealth to garner favor. It is very common for nords to have scars and bruises, or be seen walking out of a tavern with a bloody nose and a flagon of ale. </p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>BORN FOR BATTLE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Fierce warriors, and enthusiastic soldiers, Nords can be found throughout Tamriel offering their talents as mercenaries and sellswords. Proving oneself in battle is a way for any nord to increase their status. Raised from birth, they are always searching for new ways to increase their martial skills. </p>
      <p>Nords are also talented sailors. They are known to have dominated warring nations with their natural talent at sea, and have been vanguards of nautical trade.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>NORD NAMES</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Every Nord has a given name, but only some Nords have clan names. Sometimes, a Nord will be given a title, which can be used before or after their given name. A title is usually a description of a great feat or a personality trait. Such as Heinrich the Ugly or Lyra Wolf-Child.</p>

      <p>Age. Nords, like most men are not particularly long lived, and they mature at a normal rate, and almost never live longer than a century.</p>

      <p>ORSIMER (ORC)</p>
      <p>It is said that the Orcs came to be when the Aldmeri god, Trinimac, was devoured by the Daedric Prince Boethiah. As the myth goes, Boethiah excreted Trinimac's remains, and those Aldmer who followed Trinimac rubbed that excrement on themselves to become Orcs. Perhaps it's just a myth, but the imagery is appropriate: repugnant, ridiculous, and a little comical, like the Orcs themselves. </p>
      <p>-Coristir, Sage Sojourner, Civility and Etiquette</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Orcs, also called Orsimer, or "Pariah Folk" in ancient times, are considered sophisticated barbarian beast peoples, despite being a type of Mer. They are from the Wrothgarian and Dragontail Mountains and are noted for their unshakable courage in war and their unflinching endurance of hardships. In the past, Orcs have been widely feared and hated by the other nations and races of Tamriel, but they have slowly won acceptance in the Empire, in particular for their distinguished service in the Emperor's Legions. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>ORIGINS OF THE PARIAH FOLK</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Orcs were born during the latter days of the Dawn Era. History has mislabeled them beastfolk, related to the goblin races, but the Orcs are actually the children of Trinimac, strongest of the Aldmeri ancestor spirits. When Trinimac was eaten by the Daedric Prince Boethiah, and transformed in that foul god's insides, the Orcs were transformed as well. The ancient name for the 'Orsimer,' which means 'The Pariah Folk.' They now follow Malauch, better known as Malacath, the remains of Trinimac. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>STRENGTH AND STEEL</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Orcish armorers are prized for their craftsmanship, and Orc warriors in heavy armor are among the finest front-line troops in the Empire. Most Imperial citizens regard Orc society as rough and cruel, but there is much to admire in their fierce tribal loyalties and generous equality of rank and respect among the sexes. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>THE MOVING CITY</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Orsinium, which literally translates to "Orc-Town" in Aldmeris, is the city of the Orsimer and the provincial seat of what was called Wrothgar, or in the late Third Era, the Orsinium Area. It has a history of being sacked and rebuilt, as Orcs are often at odds with their neighbors. In the Second Era, it was located in the eastern part of the Wrothgar region of High Rock. In the late Third Era, it was located between Wayrest, Menevia, and the Wrothgarian Mountains, but it was sacked in the early Fourth Era. It reemerged in between Hammerfell and Skyrim later on in the era.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>A CULTURE OF CONFLICT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Most people consider their society as rough and cruel, but it's been a lifestyle of necessity. With their cities and strongholds being under constant attack throughout their history, every tribe member is trained at birth for battle and war. </p>
      <p>The strongest of warriors becomes chief of their stronghold. The women are either wives of the chief, or his daughters, with the only exception of the shaman, who takes care of spiritual matters. Only the strongest males are allowed to mate to keep the tribe strong.</p>
      <p>The Orcs do not follow the laws of man, but they follow the code of Malacath, which states: Do not steal, do not kill your kin, do not attack without cause. Those who break these rules must pay the Blood Price.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ORSIMER NAMES</p>
      <p>
         <p/>An orc has a given name and a family name. Orc family names are always prefixed depending on gender. “Gro-” for males and “Gra-” for females. A child will take the fathers name if male, or the mothers name if female. Some orcs take the family name of their stronghold where they are born.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>Male Names: Agronak, Bazur, Bogrum, Dubok, Dul, Gaturn, Ghorub, Gogron, Grommok, Hanz, Krognak, Kurz, Lumdum, Luronk, Magra, Magub, Maknok, Orok, Rugdumph, Shagol, Ulmug, Urbul, Ushnar, </p>
      <p>Female Names: Batul, Borba, Bumph, Homraz, Mazoga, Mog, Mor, Oghash, Orag, Rogbut, Rogmesh, Snak, Ugak, Umar, Umog</p>

      <p/>
      <p>ORSIMER TRAITS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Your orc character has certain traits deriving from your orc ancestry.</p>
      <p>Attribute Score Increase. Your Endurance and Willpower scores increase by 1.</p>
      <p>Age. While they are Mer, Orcs do not live as long as their distant cousins. They could live up to 80 years old, but the Code of Malacath demands that an old Orc should end his life before he becomes weak and a burden to his clan. They rarely live longer than 50 years. They reach adulthood at age 16. </p>
      <p>Alignment. The orsimer are mostly lawful neutral. Orcs follow a code and are often extremely beholden to their traditions. They are dedicated to the strength of their clan over individuals. </p>
      <p>Size. Orcs are broad and hardy, they are usually around 6 feet tall and weigh around 200 pounds. Your size in medium.</p>
      <p>Speed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p>
      <p>Aggressive. As a bonus action, you can move up to your speed toward an enemy of your choice that you can see or hear. You must end this move closer to the enemy than you started.</p>
      <p>Berserk. As an action, for the next minute you gain temporary hit points equal to twice your character level. Additionally, you gain advantage on one attack on each of your turns. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p>Blood-Kin. You share kindred blood with all of your orc brothers and sisters. Using Honor or Strength, you may be able to avoid conflict with other orcs. </p>
      <p>Menacing. You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill.</p>
      <p>Tool Proficiency. You gain proficiency with artisan's tools (smith's tools).</p>
      <p>Languages. You can speak, read, and write Tamrielic and Orcish. Orcish is a harsh, grating language with had consonants. </p>
      <p>Subraces. Three main subraces of orcs populate the continent of Tamriel: City Orcs, Wild Orcs, and Wood Orcs.</p>
      <p>CITY ORCS</p>
      <p>Not all orcs choose to live in the strongholds. Those that choose to live in the cities live a much more cosmopolitan life, but they are derided by other orcs for doing so. </p>
      <p>Attribute Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 1.</p>
      <p>Orcish Resilience. Your tough mind and body grants you resistance to force damage. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>WILD ORCS</p>
      <p>Traditional orc society is centered around living in stronghold settlements. These independent villages follow the Code of Malacath, and the strength of each tribe depends on their strongest warrior.</p>
      <p>Attribute Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 1.</p>
      <p>Powerful Build. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>WOOD ORCS</p>
      <p>Valenwood is typically home to the Bosmer, but many tribes of orcs have made this forested province their home. Like other orcs, they prize strength and honor, but to the wood orcs this means having agility and mobility as much as it does muscular power and endurance.</p>
      <p>Attribute Score Increase. Your Agility score increases by 1.</p>
      <p>Keen Hearing and Smell. You have advantage on Willpower (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. </p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>REDGUARD</p>
      <p>Standing broad-shouldered and tall, with dark skin and wiry hair, they are seemingly born with a sword in their hand. I spoke with a few of them and found them formal, obsessed with personal honor, and quite aloof. The redguards were people from another continent, and it seemed they'd brought as much of Yokuda to Tamriel as they could manage.</p>
      <p>-Flaccus Terentius, The Improved Emperor's Guide to Tamriel</p>
      <p/>
      <p>pGONS OF WAR</p>
      <p>
         <p/>The most naturally talented warriors in Tamriel, the dark-skinned, wiry-haired Redguards of Hammerfell seem born to battle, though their pride and fierce independence of spirit makes them more suitable as scouts or skirmishers, or as free-ranging heroes and adventurers, than as rank-and-file soldiers. In addition to their cultural affinities for many weapon and armor styles, Redguards are also physically blessed with hardy constitutions and quickness of foot. </p>
      <p>Custom and dress differ by district; the Redguards of Elinhir are Colovian in fashion and taste, while some in Rihad go naked in the streets. In demeanor, they are haughty and easily provoked, and, obsessed with personal honor. </p>
      <p>There is no standing army in Hammerfell, only paid militias of the oft-contested border-states and along its coastline. Ancient tradition has predisposed the Redguards to knightly order, though, customarily in the service of royal families. Initiates of these orders must prove themselves in dangerous, even deadly, tests of skill. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>THE LOST CONTINENT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>More than three thousand years ago, the continent of Yokuda suffered a cataclysm that sunk most of it into the sea, driving its people towards Tamriel. A large group of the Yokudans, called the Ra Gada, forged forward in a bloody wave, quickly slaughtering the beastfolk and Nedic villagers, paving safe travel for the Yokudans that stayed behind. The fierce Ra Gada became, phonetically, the Redguards, a name that has since spread to designate the Tamrielic-Yokudan race in general.</p>
      <p>They ultimately displaced the Nedic peoples, as their agriculture and society quickly adapted to Hammerfell's harsh environment. They took much from Nedic customs, religion, and language for themselves and their contact with the surrounding Bretons and Colovians hastened their assimilation into Tamrielic culture. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>REDGUARD NAMES</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Redguards have only their given name. Through marriage, they sometimes will take the family name.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Male Names: Amir, Azzada, Baurus, Cyrus, Daron, Ennis, Falion, Garry, Hillod, Ian, Jawana, Kayd, Lesley, Nazir, Neville, Pyke, Roderick, Shamar, Talib, Wayn</p>
      <p>Female Names: Anora, Braith, Caminda, Dahlia, Eriana, Gwen, Hussonia, Iman, Jamie, Kerah, Kiara, Lette, Minerva, Niyya, Oleta, Rona, Shelley, Tavia, Umana, Zaria</p>
      <p/>
      <p>REDGUARD TRAITS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Your Redguard character has certain characteristics in common with other Redguards. </p>
      <p>Attribute Score Increase. Your Agility, Endurance, and Strength scores increase by 1.</p>
      <p>Age. Redguards age as the rest of the the human races, rarely living over a century</p>
      <p>Alignment. Redguards mostly follow the good alignments. Many of the people of Hammerfell strictly follow their laws, while nearly an equal amount disregard them entirely.</p>
      <p>Size. Redguards are strong and tall, often over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium. </p>
      <p>Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
      <p>Adrenaline Rush. When you use this trait, your combat awareness increases for the next minute. You gain a +10 bonus to your initiative, your speed is increased by 10 feet, and you can add a d4 to all of your attack and damage rolls. Additionally, at the start of combat, when you roll initiative, you can use your reaction to immediately use this trait.</p>
      <p>You can't use this trait again until you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p>Redguard Combat Training. You are proficient in Long Blade and Short Blade.</p>
      <p>Skill Proficiency. You gain proficiency in the Athletics skill.</p>
      <p>Yokudan Lineage. Thanks to your Yokudan heritage, you have advantage on saving throws against being diseased.</p>
      <p>Languages. You can speak, read, and write Tamrielic and Yoku. Yoku is a direct language which is incredibly reliant on context. Similar to Redguards themselves, their language is straightforward and doesn't concern itself with unnecessary things. </p>

   <p>CHAPTER 3: CLASSES</p>
   <sect1 id="Section6">
      <p>Adventurers are extraordinary people, driven by a thirst for excitement into a life that others would never dare lead. They are heroes, compelled to explore the dark places of the world and take on the challenges that lesser women and men can’t stand against. </p>
      <p>Class is the primary definition of what your character can do. It’s more than a profession; it’s your character’s calling. Class shapes the way you think about the world and interact with it and your relationship with other people and powers in the universe. A warrior might view the world in terms of strategy and maneuvers, seeing herself as just a pawn in a much larger game. A crusader, by contrast, might see himself as a willing servant in a god’s unfolding plan. While the warrior has contacts in a mercenary company or army, the crusader might know a number of priests, knights, and devotees who share his faith. </p>
      <p>Your class gives you a variety of special features, such as a warrior’s mastery of weapons, and a mages’ spells. At low levels, your class gives you only two or three features, but as you advance in level you gain more and your existing features often improve. Each class entry in this chapter includes a table summarizing the benefits you gain at every level, and a detailed explanation of each one. </p>
      <p>Adventurers sometimes advance in more than one class. A rogue might switch direction in life and follow the mystical path of the spellsword. A barbarian might discover latent magical ability and dabble in the warden class while continuing to advance as a barbarian. Optional rules for combining classes in this way, called multiclassing, appear in chapter 6. </p>
      <p>Thirteen classes – listed in the classes table – are found in almost every Elder Scrolls game and define the spectrum of typical adventurers.</p>

      <p>BARBARIAN</p>
      <p>A tall nord tribesman strides through a blizzard, draped in fur and hefting his axe. He laughs as he charges toward the giant who dared poach his people’s elk herd. </p>
      <p>An orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.</p>
      <p>Frothing at the mouth, a redguard slams his helmet into the face of his dunmer foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.</p>
      <p>These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.</p>
      <p>For some, their rage springs from a connection with ancient traditions. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger from memories of past battles. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>PRIMAL INSTINCT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one’s own nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature-keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the desert, tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt.</p>
      <p>Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>A LIFE OF DANGER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Not every member of the tribes deemed “barbarians” by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don’t have to.</p>
      <p>Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>CREATING A BARBARIAN</p>
      <p>
         <p/>When creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and their place in the world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant land, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and- tumble frontier where barbarians are common?</p>
      <p>What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to “civilized” lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>QUICK BUILD</p>
      <p>You can make a barbarian quickly be following these suggestions. First, put your highest attribute score in Strength, followed by Endurance. Second, choose the outlander background.</p>
      <p/>

      <p>Hit Points at 1st Level: 12 + your Endurance modifier</p>
      <p>Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d12 (or 7) + your Endurance modifier per barbarian level after 1st.</p>

      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>RAGE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.</p>
      <p>While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:</p>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table. </p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. </p>
         </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <p>If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging. </p>
      <p>Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. </p>
      <p>Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>UNARMORED DEFENSE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Agility modifier + your Endurance modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>RECKLESS ATTACK</p>
      <p>
         <p/>
         <p/>Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make an attack, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DANGER SENSE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. </p>
      <p>You have advantage on Agility saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PRIMAL PATH</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Battleworn, the Path of the Reaver, the Path of the Savage, or the Path of the War Crier, all detailed at the end of the class description. Additionally, you can choose any Barbarian's Primal Path outlined in the Player's Handbook. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>ATTRIBUTE SCORE IMPROVEMENT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one attribute score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two attribute scores of your choice by 1. As normal,  you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>EXTRA ATTACK</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you use the Attack Action on your turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>FAST MOVEMENT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>FERAL INSTINCT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls. </p>
      <p>Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>BRUTAL CRITICAL</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack. </p>
      <p>    This increases to two additional dice at 13th level, and three additional dice at 17th level.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>RELENTLESS RAGE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Endurance saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead. </p>
      <p>Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PERSISTENT RAGE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>
         <p/>Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>INDOMITABLE MIGHT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PRIMAL CHAMPION</p>
      <p>
         <p/>
         <p/>At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Endurance scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.</p>
      <p>PRIMAL PATHS</p>
      <p>Rage burns in every barbarian's heart, a furnace that drives them towards greatness. Different barbarians attribute their rage to different sources, however. For some, their scars become symbols of victories won, while others look within to their unyielding spirits.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PATH OF THE BATTLEWORN</p>
      <p>
         <p/>For some barbarians, they are measured through battles won and they wear their scars with pride. The Path of the Battleworn is path paved with patience, pain, and perseverance. </p>
      <p>Whether an veteran legion soldier or the dedicated kin of orsimer clan, a battleworn channels their experience into their rage. </p>

      <p/>
      <p>THICK SKIN</p>
      <p>Your body is scarred and calloused from years of battle. When you choose this path at 3rd level, your unarmored AC is equal to 12 + your Agility modifier + your Endurance modifier.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>RECKLESS ABANDON</p>
      <p>Beginning at 6th level, when you use Reckless Attack while raging, you also gain temporary hit points equal to your Endurance modifier (minimum of 1). They vanish if any of them are left when your rage ends.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>BATTLE SCARS</p>
      <p>At 10th level, your scarred body and strong presence is readily noticeable. You have advantage on all Intimidation checks.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>BOILING POINT</p>
      <p>Starting at 14th level, while raging, you push your attacks beyond their natural limits. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one hit die and a d12 to your damage roll.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PATH OF THE REAVER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Barbarians that follow the Path of the Reaver are brutal hunters that strike in well orchestrated packs, leaving behind nothing but corpses and destruction.</p>
      <p>Despite their primitive behavior, reavers often make up the important front lines of tactical combat. The forsworn of the reach and the aggressive wood orc clans commonly use these maneuvers to intimidate their foes and catch them off guard. </p>

      <p>ACCELERATED REGENERATION</p>
      <p>When you choose this path at 3rd level, your wounds naturally stitch together at a faster rate. When you use hit dice to recover hit points during a short rest, you gain additional hit points equal to 1d12 + your Endurance modifier.</p>
      <p/>

      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>REAVER'S CHARGE</p>
      <p>Beginning at 3rd level, when you enter into a rage, your speed doubles for the rest of your turn. You can only use this additional speed to move towards an enemy. Additionally, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action on your subsequent turns while you are raging.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PACT TACTICS</p>
      <p>At 6th level, while raging, you have advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of your allies are within 5 feet of you and the ally isn't unconscious.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DREAD WARRIOR</p>
      <p>Beginning at 10th level, your physique is so intimidating that you inspire dread in your enemies. You can use a bonus action to make yourself appear exceptionally fearful. Every creature within 10 feet of you suffers from one of the following effects of your choice: </p>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>Disadvantage on Strength and Agility checks</p>

            <p>Disadvantage on Willpower and Personality checks</p>

            <p>All intimidation checks by you and your allies have advantage.</p>
         </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <p>This effect lasts up to 1 minute, as though you were concentrating on a spell. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>REAVER'S VERDICT</p>
      <p>Beginning at 14th level, while raging, you can attack three times, instead of twice, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>

      <p>PATH OF THE SAVAGE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Some barbarians only know destruction and violence. The Path of the Savage is a path of fury and death, learned from years of war. These tribes pass down their techniques and strategies to their cubs and kin, further honing their skills with every new generation.</p>
      <p>Myths and tales of warnings spread throughout nearby towns and villages where these barbarian tribes exist. </p>

      <p>FRENZIED ARMSMAN </p>
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, while you are raging, you are able to exploit your weapons to become even more devastating. You gain the following benefits when wielding a weapon type listed below:</p>
      <p/>
      <p>AXES</p>
      <p>Once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature with an axe weapon, make a second attack roll. If your second roll would also hit the creature, you rend the target, causing them to bleed extensively. Your attack deals an additional 1d6 necrotic damage. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>BLUNT</p>
      <p>Your attacks are exceptionally forceful and can penetrate even the most tempered armors. You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls made with blunt weapons. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>LONG BLADES</p>
      <p>When you attack with a long blade weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>UPPERCUT</p>
      <p>At 6th level, when you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo your movement and a possible bonus action to use one of your attacks to make a powerful upward blow.</p>
      <p>Make a melee weapon attack. If the attack hits a creature, you deal damage as normal and it must make a Strength saving throw with a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier. On a failed save, the target is knocked back 10 feet and left prone. On a successful save, the creature has disadvantage on attacks until the start of your next turn. This ability can only affect large or smaller creatures. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>HEAVY LIFTING</p>
      <p>Beginning at 10th level, while you are raging and not wearing heavy armor, you are able to engage in two-weapon fighting with all weapons except for those with the heavy or two handed properties. </p>
      <p>Additionally, weapons with the heavy or two handed properties can be held in one hand.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>RELENTLESS STORM</p>
      <p>At 14th level, you can use your action to whirl around, attacking all enemies within range of your melee weapon. Roll a septe attack roll for each creature you attack. While whirling, you can move up to half your movement speed. Any opportunity attacks against you have disadvantage while moving.</p>
      <p>PATH OF THE WAR CRIER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>The Path of the War Crier is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian learns to channel their life essence through their voice and breath. War Criers are rare in barbarian tribes, but those who have the gift are usually put into positions of power, either as shaman, spiritual leaders, or chieftains. </p>
      <p>Most nords have some innate capacity for the power of the voice, believing that their breath holds their vital essence. The other races can learn how to wield such power, but may require greater study, perhaps spending time with powerful Tongues.</p>

      <p>BATTLE THU'UM</p>
      <p>When you choose this path at 3rd level, you learn how to harness the power of the dragon tongue to form powerful shouts. A shout requires you to spend shout points each time you use it.</p>
      <p>Shouts. You know the Unrelenting Force shout and one other shout of your choice, which are detailed in the “Dragon Shouts” section below. You learn two additional shouts of your choice at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. </p>
      <p>Whenever you learn a new shout, you can also replace one shout that you already know with a different shout.</p>
      <p>Shout Points. You have 2 shout points and you regain any expended shout points when you finish a short or long rest. </p>
      <p>You gain two additional shout points at 6th level (4), and again at 10th level (6), and 14th level (8).</p>
      <p>Using Words of Power. The Thu'um is a form of magic which uses words from the draconic language to form powerful shouts to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don't need to use any magicka to cast it. </p>
      <p>Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional shout points to increase the level of a Battle Shout spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as unrelenting force does. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional shout point you spend. </p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>The maximum number of shout points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base shout cost and any additional shout points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your barbarian level, as shown in the Spells and Shout Points table.</p>

      <p>Some of your Battle Thum features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
      <p>Battle Thu'um save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Endurance modifier </p>
      <p/>
      <p>DRACONIC TONGUE</p>
      <p>Starting at 6th level, you gain a mastery with draconic words. You are now proficient in the dovahzul language.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>FRENZIED SHOUTS</p>

      <p>If you are able to cast other spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>DRAGON SHOUTS</p>
      <p>The dragon shouts are presented at the level you must be to learn them.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>At 3rd level, you learn Unrelenting Force and one other shout of your choice listed below.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Clear Skies (Lok Vah Koor)</p>
      <p>You can spend 1 shout point to use your voice to clear out all thick clouds, overcast sky, poisonous fog, or impeding haze, that is within 1 mile of you.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Blinding Winds (Ven Fus Vokun)</p>
      <p>You can spend 1 shout point to create a powerful wind storm in a 60 foot-radius, centered on you. The wind blows in all directions, causing dust and refuse to heavily obscure the area.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the area is considered difficult terrain, and any projectile that is within or enters the area, has disadvantage on hitting its target.</p>
      <p>The winds lasts up to 1 minute, as though ou were concentrating on a spell. You can use a bonus action on your turn to disperse the winds. </p>
      <p>Unrelenting Force (Fus Ro Dah)</p>
      <p>You can spend 1 shout point to cast the alteration spell Thunder Wave. The spells level increases for each additional shout point you spend.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Whirlwind Sprint (Wuld Nah Kest)</p>
      <p>You can use a bonus action and spend 1 shout point to double your speed for one turn. While you are under these effects, any opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Starting at 6th level, you can choose to learn two of the shouts listed below or from the previous list. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>Animal Allegiance (Raan Mir Tah)</p>
      <p>You can spend 1 shout point to cast the spell Animal Friendship.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Aura Whisper (Laas Yah Nir)</p>
      <p>You can spend 1 shout point to whisper a detection spell that allows you you sense the presence of life within 30 feet of you. The spell lasts up to 10 minutes, as though you are concentrating on it. </p>
      <p>If you sense life in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature in the area that bears life. </p>
      <p>The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.</p>
      <p>    </p>
      <p>Disarm (Zun Haal Viik)</p>
      <p>You can use 2 shout points to use your voice to focus vibrations on a weapon currently being wielded by a creature within 30 feet. The creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature drops their weapon. On a successful save, the creature has disadvantage on any attacks made with that weapon until the start of your next turn.</p>
      <p>    If a creature tries to pick up a dropped weapon, they must use half their speed and make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is incapable of picking up the weapon. On a successful save, the creature is able to pick up the weapon and the effect ends. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>Gale Winds (Ven Mul Riik)</p>
      <p>You can spend 1 shout point to cast the alteration spell Gust of Wind.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Marked for Death (Krii Lun Aus)</p>
      <p>You can spend 1 shout point to cast the conjuration spell Hunter's Mark.</p>
      
      
      <p>Starting at 10th level, you can choose to learn two of the shouts listed below or from the previous lists. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>Battle Fury (Mid Vur Shaan)</p>
      <p>You can spend 3 shout points to cast the illusion spell Haste on yourself. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>Call of Valor (Hun Kaal Zoor)</p>
      <p>You can spend 1 shout point to cast the illusion spell Heroism.  </p>
      <p/>
      <p>Cyclone (Ven Gar Nos)</p>
      <p>You can spend 2 shout points to cast the alteration spell Dust Devil. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>Ice Form (Iiz Slen Nus)</p>
      <p>You can spend 2 shout points to attempt to freeze a target that you can see that is within 60 feet of you.</p>
      <p>The target must make a Strength saving throw to resist the spell. On a failed save, the target takes 4d8 cold damage and they are encased in a shell of frost. The encased creature is immobilized and can't speak, hear, move, or make any actions. The creature takes this damage again on each subsequent turn while the spell persists.</p>
      <p>The creature restrained by this spell must make another Strength saving throw at the start of each of their turns to try and break free. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, the frost hardens and the creature is subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind. </p>
      <p>On a successful save, the creature takes half of much damage and isn't immobilized. </p>
      <p>While the spell is active, the frost shell has an AC of 5 and has 60 hit points. When the frost shell reaches 0 hit points, the shell breaks, ending the spell effect. A dispel magic spell can also reverse the effects.</p>
      <p/>

      <p/>
      <p>Starting at 14th level, you can choose to learn two of the shouts listed below or from the previous lists. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>Breath</p>
      <p>You can spend 3 shout points to exhale an element of your choice. Choose either fire, cold, lightning, or poison. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make an Endurance saving throw. A creature takes 6d8 elemental damage on a failed save, and half as much on a successful one. Example shouts are Fire Breath (Yol Toor Shul, and Frost Breath (Fo Krah Diin).</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Dismay (Faas Ru Maar)</p>
      <p>You can spend 3 shout points to cast the illusion spell Fear.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Dragon Aspect (Mul Qah Diiv)</p>
      <p>You can spend 6 shout points to take on the aspect of a dragon for 1 minute. While in this form, your AC can't be less than 20. Additionally, each of your melee weapon attack and damage rolls increase by +2.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Storm Call (Strun Bah Qo)</p>
      <p>You can spend 3 shout points to cast the destruction spell Call Lighting. </p>

      <p>BARD</p>
      <p>Humming as she traces her fingers over an ancient monument in a long-forgotten ruin, a bosmer in rugged leathers finds knowledge springing into her mind, conjured forth by the magic of her song—knowledge of the people who constructed the monument and the mythic saga it depicts.</p>
      <p>A stern imperial soldier bangs his sword rhythmically against his scale mail, setting the tempo for his war chant and exhorting his companions to bravery and heroism. The magic of his song fortifies and emboldens them.</p>
      <p>Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a nord weaves her subtle magic over the assembled nobles, ensuring that her companions’ words will be well received.</p>
      <p>Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>MUSIC AND MAGIC</p>
      <p>
         <p/>On Nirn, words and music are not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the mundas was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers. </p>
      <p>The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>LEARNING FROM EXPERIENCE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>True bards are not common in the world. Not every minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard’s life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.</p>
      <p>Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon—makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CREATING A BARD</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true or not. Your character’s background and motivations are not as important as the stories that he or she tells about them. Perhaps you had a secure and mundane childhood. There’s no good story to be told about that, so you might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag in a dismal swamp. Or your childhood might be worthy of a story. Some bards acquire their magical music through extraordinary means, including the inspiration of fey or other supernatural creatures. </p>
      <p>Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a master, following the more experienced bard until you were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you attend a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway or orphan, befriended by a wandering bard who became your mentor. Or you might have been a spoiled noble child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?</p>
      <p/>
      <p>QUICK BUILD</p>
      <p>You can make a bard quickly by following these suggestions. First, Personality should be your highest attribute score, followed by Agility. Second, choose the entertainer background. Third, choose the dancing lights and vicious mockery cantrips, along with the following 1st level spells: charm person, detect magic, healing word, and thunderwave.</p>

         </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <p/>
      <p>SPELLCASTING</p>
      <p>
         <p/>You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the bard spell list.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CANTRIPS</p>
      <p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>MAGICKA</p>
      <p>The Bard table shows how much magicka you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend magicka, as noted in the spell's description and the Magicka Cost table found in chapter 10. You regain all expended magicka when you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p>    For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a Spell Level of 2nd, you can cast cure wounds using magicka to cast it at either level. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</p>
      <p>You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list. </p>
      <p>The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you can cast, as shown on the table's Spell Level column for your level. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.   </p>
      <p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level that you can cast.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SPELLCASTING ATTRIBUTE</p>
      <p>Personality is your spellcasting attribute for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Personality whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting attribute. In addition, you use your Personality modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. </p>
      <p>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + </p>
      <p>your Personality modifier </p>
      <p>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + </p>
      <p>your Personality modifier</p>
      <p/>
      <p>RITUAL CASTING</p>
      <p>You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>BARDIC INSPIRATION</p>
      <p>
         <p/>You can inspire others through your stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature, other than yourself, within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.</p>
      <p>Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.</p>
      <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Personality modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. </p>
      <p>Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in the class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>JACK OF ALL TRADES</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SONG OF REST</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one more more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.</p>
      <p>The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in the class to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>BARD COLLEGE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Revelries, or the College of Solitude, both detailed at the end of the class description. Additionally, you can choose any Bard's Bard College outlined in the Player's Handbook. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>EXPERTISE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. </p>
      <p>At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>ATTRIBUTE SCORE IMPROVEMENT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one attribute score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two attribute scores of your choice by 1. As normal,  you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>FONT OF INSPIRATION</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>COUNTERCHARM</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain the benefit, The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).</p>
      <p/>
      <p>MAGICAL SECRETS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any classes, including this one. A spell you choose must be a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip.</p>
      <p>The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.</p>
      <p>You learn two additional spells from any classes at 14th level and again at 18th level.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SUPERIOR INSPIRATION</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>BARD COLLEGES</p>
      <p>The way of a bard is gregarious. Bards seek each other out to swap songs and stories, boast of their accomplishments, and share their knowledge. Bards form loose associations, which they call colleges, to facilitate their gatherings and preserve their traditions.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>COLLEGE OF REVERIES</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Bards of the College of Reveries are renowned performers and artists. All members of the college are handpicked for their passion and are taught to live for the love of their craft, and for the thrill of the performance. </p>
      <p>Unlike many other colleges, those who study under the Grand Maestro are encouraged to discard their identities and take on a new persona. All of the players in the College of Reveries wear anonymous painted masks and take up new names, often associated with their act. </p>
      <p>Any bard willing to remove the shackles of selfishness to live solely for the art will find a place in the college. They use their anonymity to gain a thousand faces, though they never show their own.  </p>

      <p>BONUS PROFICIENCIES</p>
      <p>When you join the College of Reveries at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in disguise kits, forgery kits, and an artisan tool of your choice. You also learn one language of your choice.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PERFORMER'S VAINGLORY</p>
      <p>At 3rd level, you become invigorated when you witness someone being inspired by your own performances. When at least one creature you have inspired with your Bardic Inspiration is within 30 feet of you and they still have their Bardic Inspiration die, you gain a bonus to your attacks. When your attack hits a target, roll a die equal to your Bardic Inspiration die and add that number to the attacks damage roll.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PLAYER'S MUSE</p>
      <p>Additionally at 3rd level, adventurer's of the College of Reveries gain a persona that represents their performing act. This persona is a disguise that includes a mask and garb that hides the wearer's original identity. While wearing this disguise, other bards and patrons recognize you as your persona. You have advantage on Personality (Persuasion) and Personality (Performance) checks when speaking with fans of your work.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>FLEXIBLE PERFORMANCE</p>
      <p>When you reach 6th level, you weave in the pageantry and pomposity of your performances into your everyday conversations. You can use your Performance skill instead of Deception when trying to impersonate someone, and instead of Intimidation when trying to demoralize someone. You can also use Performance instead of Persuasion when trying to flatter someone.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>COMPELLING INSPIRATION</p>
      <p>At 14th level, your inspiring performances can compel even your harshest critics. You can use your Bardic Inspiration on a creature within 60 feet of you and force it to make a Willpower saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is compelled by you until the start of your next turn. The compelled creature has disadvantage on all attack rolls, and all attacks made against the compelled creature have advantage.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>COLLEGE OF SOLITUDE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>High in the frigid north, the College of Solitude is found in the city of the same name, the capital of Skyrim. Living and studying in the north comes with its own challenges, and the bards that attend this college are taught how to endure the harsh conditions while rallying their allies to keep pushing through.</p>

      <p>BONUS PROFICIENCIES</p>
      <p>When you join the College of Solitude at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor, as well as axe and blunt weapons.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>FIGHTING STYLE</p>
      <p>At 3rd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if something in the game lets you choose again.</p>
      <p>ARCHERY</p>
      <p>You gain a +2 bonus to your attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DUELING</p>
      <p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
      <p>GREAT WEAPON FIGHTING</p>
      <p>When you roll a 1 or a 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if it is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING</p>
      <p>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DISARMING CHARISMA</p>
      <p>When you reach 6th level, you gain the ability to use your charisma to cause your enemies to falter. As a reaction, when a creature attacks you with a melee strike, you gain a +2 bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn. </p>
      <p>You can use this feature an amount of times equal to your personality modifier. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p>Beginning at 17th level, you gain a +4 bonus to your AC when you use this feature.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>BATTLE ANTHEM</p>
      <p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to use your instruments or voice to inspire your allies in the heat of battle. As an action, all allies or enemies within 60 feet of you that can see and hear you, gain one effect of your choice for the duration of the anthem. The effect lasts up to 1 minute, as though you are concentrating on a spell. As an action on your following turns you can change the effect of your Battle Anthem.</p>
      <p>Anthem of War. Each ally that can see and hear you gains advantage on attack rolls for the duration.</p>
      <p>Anthem of Protection. Each ally that can see and hear you gains a +2 bonus to their AC for the duration.</p>
      <p>Anthem of Intimidation. Each enemy that can see and hear you has disadvantage on saving throws for the duration.</p>
      <p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest to be able to use it again.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>CRUSADER</p>
      <p>Clad in plate armor that gleams in the sunlight despite the dust and grime of long travel, a breton lays down her sword and shield and places her hands on a mortally wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man’s wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.</p>
      <p>A dunmer crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realize he is there. </p>
      <p>Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate only him, an altmer laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its hideous darkness.</p>
      <p>Whatever their origin and their mission, crusaders are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god’s altar and the witness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a crusader's devotion is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>THE CAUSE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>A crusader swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different crusaders focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the devotions that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many crusaders are devoted to gods of good, a crusader’s power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god. </p>
      <p>Crusaders train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight for justice. </p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>BEYOND THE MUNDANE LIFE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Almost by definition, the life of a crusader is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for a time, every crusader lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Warriors are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true calling of a crusader. When they do receive the call, these champions turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their devotions lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.</p>
      <p>Adventuring crusaders take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CREATING A CRUSADER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>The most important aspect of a crusader character is the nature of his or her holy quest. Although the class features related to your devotion don't appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading the devotion descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the gods of justice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the light, cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the shadow, a knight whose oath descends from traditions older than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered loner sworn to take vengeance on those who have done great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven by your need for revenge? </p>
      <p>How did you experience your call to serve as a crusader? Did you hear a whisper from an unseen god  while you were at prayer? Did another crusader sense the potential within you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some terrible event—the destruction of your home, perhaps— drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest memories that the crusader’s life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose stamped on your soul. </p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>As guardians against the forces of wickedness, crusaders are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how your alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest and the manner in which you conduct yourself before gods and mortals. Your devotion and alignment might be in harmony, or your oath might represent standards of behavior you have not yet attained.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>QUICK BUILD</p>
      <p>You can make a crusader quickly by following these suggestions. First Willpower should be your highest attribute score, followed by Strength. Second, choose the noble background.</p>

   <sect1 id="Section11">
      <p>DIVINE SENSE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial (aedra), fiend (daedra), or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell. </p>
      <p>    You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Personality modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>FIGHTING STYLE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>You adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ARCHERY</p>
      <p>You gain a +2 bonus to your attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DEFENSE</p>
      <p>While wearing armor, you gain +1 bonus to AC.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DUELING</p>
      <p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>GREAT WEAPON FIGHTING</p>
      <p>When you roll a 1 or a 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if it is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PROTECTION</p>
      <p>When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is withing 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>SPELLCASTING</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 2nd level, you have learned to draw magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the crusader spell list.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CANTRIPS</p>
      <p>You know three cantrips of your choice from the crusader spell list. You learn additional crusader cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Crusader table.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</p>
      <p>The Crusader table shows how much magicka you have to cast your crusader spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend magicka, as noted in the spell's description and the Magicka Cost table found in chapter 10. You regain all expended magicka when you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p>You prepare the list of crusader spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the crusader spell list. When you do so, choose a number of crusader spells equal to your Willpower modifier + your crusader level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you can cast.</p>
      <p>For example, if you are a 3rd-level crusader, you can cast a prepared spell at either 1st or 2nd level. With a Willpower of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it at either 1st or 2nd level. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
      <p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of crusader spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SPELLCASTING ATTRIBUTE</p>
      <p>Willpower is your spellcasting ability for your crusader spells. You use your Willpower whenever a crusader spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Willpower modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a crusader spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
      <p>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +</p>
      <p>your Willpower modifier</p>
      <p>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +</p>
      <p>your Willpower  modifier</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>RITUAL CASTING</p>
      <p>You can cast a crusader spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>CHANNEL DIVINITY</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. As you gain levels in the Crusader class, you may learn additional effects determined by your Devotion. </p>
      <p>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>
      <p>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your crusader spell save DC.</p>
      <p>Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level. you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</p>
      <p>As an action, you speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Willpower saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>
      <p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DIVINE SMITE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend magicka to deal lightning damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. </p>
      <p>The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st level spell, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st. to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a daedra, to a maximum of 6d8.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DIVINE HEALTH</p>
      <p>
         <p/>By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease. </p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>DEVOTION</p>
      <p>
         <p/>When you reach 3rd level, you devote yourself by following a way of life that defines you as a Crusader. Now you choose how you are sworn to your deity by becoming either a Healer, Knight, Pilgrim, Templar, or Witch Hunter, all detailed at the end of the class description. </p>
      <p>Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include devotion spells and a Channel Divinity feature.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DEVOTION SPELLS</p>
      <p>Each devotion has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the devotion description. Once you gain access to a devotion spell, you always have it prepared. Devotion spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>
      <p>If you gain a devotion spell that doesn't appear on the crusader spell list, the spell is nonetheless a crusader spell for your.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ATTRIBUTE SCORE IMPROVEMENT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one attribute score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two attribute scores of your choice by 1. As normal,  you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>EXTRA ATTACK</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>AURA OF PROTECTION</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Willpower modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus. </p>
      <p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>AURA OF COURAGE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you are conscious.</p>
      <p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>
      <p>IMPROVED DIVINE SMITE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous</p>
      <p>might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine</p>
      <p>power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a</p>
      <p>melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 lightning damage. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>BANE OF EVIL</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 13th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is 3 or lower.</p>
      <p>The challenge rating threshold increases to 4 when you reach 17th level.</p>
      <p>If you are able to repel fiends as well as undead with your Channel Divinity feature, any fiends that fail their saving throw, and meet the challenge rating threshold mentioned above, are instantly banished back to their plane of Oblivion.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CLEANSING TOUCH</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to</p>
      <p>end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature</p>
      <p>that you touch. </p>
      <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal</p>
      <p>to your Willpower modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DEVOTIONS</p>
      <p>Becoming a crusader involves taking vows that commit the crusader to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. Their final devotion is the culmination of all the crusader's training.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>HEALER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Healers are spellcasters who swear solemn oaths to heal the afflicted and cure the diseased. When threatened, they defend themselves with reason and disabling attacks and magic, relying on deadly force only in extremity. </p>
      <p>Harnessing powerful magic, healers control a form of  restorative potential far beyond the scope of most clerics and priests. This intense effectiveness comes from years of study, a passion for benevolence, and perhaps blessed by the divines, healers </p>

      <p>SUPERIOR RESTORATION </p>
      <p>At 3rd level, your superior knowledge in the healing arts allows you to cast powerful spells above your skill level. Choose one 2nd-level spell from your Crusader Spell list or Healer Devotion Spells. You can cast this unique spell once without expending any magicka. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>
      <p>This spell does not count against your number of prepared spell and you can't cast this spell using magicka unless you have it prepared and it is of a spell level you can cast. When you reach 11th level, you can choose a spell from the Superior Restoration Spells list.</p>
      <p>At higher levels, you gain more spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: you learn one 3rd-level spell at 5th level, one 4th-level spell at 7th level, one 5th-level spell at 9th level, one 6th-level spell at 11th level, one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. </p>
      <p>You regain all uses of your Superior Restoration spells when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <p>CHANNEL DIVINITY</p>
      <p>When you choose this devotion at 3rd level, you gain the following Channel Divinity options.</p>
      <p>Preserve Life. You can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured. As an action, you evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your Crusader level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on the undead or a construct.</p>
      <p>Protection from Harm. You can use your Channel Divinity to protect yourself form harm. When you are directly attacked with a weapon or a harmful spell, you can use a reaction to create a magical ward that gives you resistance to all types of damage until the start of your next turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>AURA OF WARDING</p>
      <p>Beginning at 7th level, ancient magic lies so heavily upon you that it forms an eldritch ward. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to damage from spells.</p>
      <p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DIVINE SMITE: FIRE</p>
      <p>At 7th level, whenever you use the Divine Smite feature, you can choose to infuse your weapon strikes with fire damage instead of lightning.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>BLESSED HEALER</p>
      <p>At 15th level, your life essence is imbued with healing energy that you can use to heal yourself and other creatures. As a bonus action, you can touch a creature and heal it. With each touch, a creature regains from 1d6 to 5d6 hit points (your choice). You have a total pool of 15d6 you can expend. Subtract the dice you use with each touch from that total. </p>
      <p>You regain all expended dice from your pool when you finish a long rest. </p>

      <p>ELDER CHAMPION</p>
      <p>At 20th level, you can assume the form of your deity, taking on their appearance, as you choose. </p>
      <p>Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:</p>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit points.</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>Whenever you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action instead.</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>Enemy creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on saving throws against your spells and Channel Divinity options.</p>
         </listitem>

      <p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

      <p>KNIGHT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Of noble birth, or distinguished in battle or tourney, knights are civilized warriors, schooled in letters and courtesy, governed by the codes of chivalry. In addition to the arts of war, knights study the lore of healing and enchantment. </p>
      <p>Knights are warriors who pledge service to rulers, religious orders, and noble causes. They are known for their moralistic nature and principled behavior, pledging their honor to those who share their righteous endeavors.</p>

      <p>KNIGHT TRAINING</p>
      <p>When you choose this devotion at 3rd level, you gain the following proficiencies:</p>
      <p>Armor: Heavy Armor</p>
      <p>Weapons: Axe and Long Blade</p>
      <p>Skills: Athletics and Persuasion</p>
      <p>Tools: Smith's Tools</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CHANNEL DIVINITY</p>
      <p>When you choose this devotion at 3rd level, you gain the following Channel Divinity options.</p>
      <p>Champion Challenge. You issue a challenge that compels other creatures to do battle with you. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Willpower saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't willingly move more than 30 feet from you. This effect ends on the creature if you are incapacitated or die or if the creature is moved more than 30 feet away from you.</p>
      <p>War God's Blessing. You can use your Channel Divinity to guide your allies attacks with supernatural accuracy. When a creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to grant that creature a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DIVINE ALLEGIANCE</p>
      <p>At 7th level, when a creature within 5 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to magically substitute your own health for that of the target creature, causing that creature not to take the damage. Instead, you take the damage. This damage to you can't be reduced or prevented in any way.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DIVINE SMITE: FORCE</p>
      <p>Also at 7th level, whenever you use the Divine Smite feature, you can choose to infuse your weapon strikes with force damage instead of lightning.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>UNYIELDING SPIRIT</p>
      <p>Starting at 15th level, you have advantage on saving throws to avoid becoming plyzed or stunned.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>

      <p>EXALTED CHAMPION</p>
      <p>At 20th level, your presence on the field of battle is an inspiration to those dedicated to your cause. You can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 hour:</p>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical weapons.</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>Your allies have advantage on death saving throws while within 30 feet of you.</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>You have advantage on Willpower saving throws, as do your allies within 30 feet of you.</p>
         </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <p>This affect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PILGRIM</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Pilgrims are travelers and wayfarers who are constantly on the move, seeking out truth and enlightenment. Being immersed in new cultures and always surrounding themselves with new ideas keeps their minds and hearts open.</p>
      <p>They are well-versed in tomes of old, and get through life by bartering in the market or persuading the weak-minded. Pilgrims are naturally charismatic and their travels bring fascinating stories to tell. Their journeys can also bring out a nefarious side. The inability to lay down roots and build long lasting relationships can cause a person to grow cold and self-indulgent. Some pilgrims find themselves akin to snake-oil salesmen, profiting off of shams or deceit before moving on to the next mark.</p>

      <p>BONUS PROFICIENCIES</p>
      <p>When you choose this devotion at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in History, Stealth, Thieves' Tools, and either a Musical Instrument or an Artisan's Tools of your choice. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>CHANNEL DIVINITY</p>
      <p>When you choose this devotion at 3rd level, you gain the following Channel Divinity options.</p>
      <p>Guided Strike. You can use your Channel Divinity to strike with supernatural accuracy. When you make an attack roll, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.</p>
      <p>Knowledge of the Ages. You can use your Channel Divinity to tap into a divine well of knowledge. As an action, you choose one skill or tool. For 10 minutes, you have proficiency with the chosen skill or tool.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>
         <anchor id="toc3"/>CHANNEL DIVINITY: READ THOUGHTS</p>
      <p>At 7th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to read a creature’s thoughts. You can then use your access to the creature’s mind to command it.</p>
      <p>As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Willpower saving throw. If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, you can’t use this feature on it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p>If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its current emotions and what it is actively thinking about) when it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts for 1 minute.</p>
      <p>During that time, you can use your action to end this effect and cast the suggestion spell on the creature without expending any magicka. The target automatically fails its saving throw against the spell.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DIVINE SMITE: POISON</p>
      <p>Also at 7th level, whenever you use the Divine Smite feature, you can choose to infuse your weapon strikes with poison damage instead of lightning.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>AURA OF VALOR</p>
      <p>Starting at 15th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you add your Willpower modifier to their attack rolls.</p>
      <p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>DILETTANTE CHAMPION</p>
      <p>At 20th level, you draw on your diverse experience to amplify your expertise. You can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 hour.</p>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>You add your Willpower modifier to your weapon damage rolls.</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>Your AC increases by an amount equal to your Willpower modifier.</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>As a bonus action on your turn, you may apply the benefits of the Help action to a number of friendly creatures equal to half of your Willpower modifier, rounded up (minimum of 1) within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you. </p>
         </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <p>This affect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>TEMPLAR</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Templars are resolute devotees of the light who have sworn to help the sick and protect the weak. These traveling knights call upon the powers of light and the burning sun to smite their enemies, defend their allies, and heal the sick. </p>
      <p>Those that follow Stendarr are priests that clothe themselves in his righteous aura of blessed light. They are worshipers who renounce all forms of violence and freely spread knowledge of cleansing and healing rituals. Following the word of Stendarr, they seek out abominations and unnatural profanities that are abhorrent in their eyes. Purging daedra, undead, Hircines man-beasts, and Molag Bal's vampires from the Mundus.</p>
      <p>Templars in accord with Meridia have similar goals. They relentlessly pursue the undead, cleansing risen corpses whose rotting bodies persist with a loathsome and unnatural vigor, and the vampires that feast upon honest citizens.</p>

      <p>BONUS PROFICIENCIES</p>
      <p>At 3rd level, you become proficient in heavy armor and land vehicles.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SUNLIGHT MASTERY</p>
      <p>When you choose this devotion at 3rd level, you gain mastery with the effects of sunlight. Whenever you cast a spell that deals radiant damage, you can add  your Willpower modifier to the damage. This amount is doubled against undead creatures.  </p>
      <p/>
      <p>CHANNEL DIVINITY</p>
      <p>When you choose this devotion at 3rd level, you gain the following Channel Divinity options.</p>
      <p>Radiance of Dawn. You can use your Channel Divinity to harness sunlight, banishing darkness and dealing radiant damage to your foes.</p>
      <p>As an action, you conjure a burst of light and any magical darkness within 30 feet of you is dispelled. Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make an Endurance saving throw. A creature takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your Crusader level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.</p>
      <p>Turn the Tide. As a bonus action, you can bolster injured creatures with your Channel Divinity. Each creature of your choice that can hear you within 30 feet of you regains hit points equal to 1d6 + your Willpower modifier (minimum of 1) if it has no more than half of its hit points.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>WARDING FLARE</p>
      <p>Starting at 7th level, you can interpose divine light between your allies and an attacking enemy. When you or an ally are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, causing light to flare before the attacker before it hits or misses. An attacker that can’t be blinded is immune to this feature.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Willpower modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DIVINE SMITE: RADIANT</p>
      <p>Also at 7th level, whenever you use the Divine Smite feature, you can choose to infuse your weapon strikes with radiant damage instead of lightning.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>RADIANT RESILIENCE</p>
      <p>Starting at 15th level, you gain temporary hit points  whenever you finish a long or short rest. These temporary hit points equal your Crusader level + your Willpower modifier. Additionally, choose up to five creatures you can see at the end of your rest. Those creatures gain temporary hit points equal to half your Crusader level + your Willpower modifier.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SUN SHIELD</p>
      <p>At 20th level, you become wreathed in a luminous aura. You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. You can extinguish or restore the light as a bonus action. </p>
      <p>If a creature hits you with a melee attack while this light shines,  you can use your reaction to deal radiant damage to the creature. The radiant damage equals 5 + your Willpower modifier.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>WITCH HUNTER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Witch hunters are dedicated to rooting out and destroying the perverted practices of dark cults and profane sorcery. They train for martial, magical, and stealthy war against vampires, witches, warlocks, and necromancers. </p>

      <p>Choose a type of favored enemy: fiends, shape-shifters, or undead. You gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with weapon attacks against creatures of the chosen type. Additionally, you have advantage on Willpower (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.</p>
      <p>When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice, typically one spoken by your favored enemy or creatures associated with it. However, you are free to pick any language you wish to learn. </p>
      <p>The additional damage increases to +4 against your chosen favored enemy when you reach 11th level.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CHANNEL DIVINITY</p>
      <p>When you choose this devotion at 3rd level, you gain the following Channel Divinity options.</p>
      <p>Destructive Wrath. You can use your Channel Divinity to wield the power of destruction with unchecked ferocity. </p>
      <p>When you cast a Destruction spell, you can use your Channel Divinity to deal maximum damage, instead of rolling. You must choose to use this feature prior to rolling the damage dealt.</p>
      <p>Turn Evil. When you use your Channel Divinity to Turn Undead, you also attempt to turn any fiends that are within range. </p>
      <p>All fiends and undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Willpower saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>
      <p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>
      <p>Additionally, all fiends and undead within 30 feet of you immediately take fire damage equal to half your Crusader level + your Willpower Modifier on a failed save, and half as much on a successful one.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>POTENT SPELLCASTING</p>
      <p>Starting at 7th level, you add your Willpower modifier to the damage you deal with any cantrip.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DIVINE SMITE: NECROTIC</p>
      <p>Also at 7th level, whenever you use the Divine Smite feature, you can choose to infuse your weapon strikes with necrotic damage instead of lightning.</p>
      <p>    </p>
      <p>PURITY OF SPIRIT</p>
      <p>Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a protection from evil and good spell.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CIRCLE OF PROTECTION</p>
      <p>Starting at 20th level, you can use an action to brand the earth with a 15-foot radius rune of protection, imposing disadvantage to all attacks made against you and any of your allies within the circle. The circle lasts until a new Circle of Protection is created.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the first time any fiend or undead creatures enters the circle or starts its turn there during a battle, the creature must succeed a Willpower saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Attack rolls against a frightened creature have advantage.</p>
      <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>MAGE</p>
      <p>Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, a breton closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the battlefield and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers. </p>
      <p>Checking and rechecking his work, a dunmer scribes an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones a long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle, bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly plane beyond.</p>
      <p>Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, an argonian tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly, he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the passage to his left.</p>
      <p>Mages are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, mages cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or knit the wounds of their allies. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SCHOLARS OF THE ARCANE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study. </p>
      <p>Mages live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other mages, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures that are steeped in magic.</p>

      <p>THE LURES OF KNOWLEDGE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Mages’ lives are seldom mundane. The closest a mage is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the secrets of the mundas. Other mages sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination. </p>
      <p>But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous mages out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most mages believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.</p>
      <p>CREATING A MAGE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Creating a mage character demands a backstory dominated by at least one extraordinary event. How did your character first come into contact with magic? How did you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do you have a natural talent, or did you simply study hard and practice incessantly? Did you encounter a magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the basics of magic? </p>
      <p>What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your first taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for more? Have you received word of a secret repository of knowledge not yet plundered by any other mage? Perhaps you’re simply eager to put your new-found magical skills to the test in the face of danger.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>QUICK BUILD</p>
      <p>You can make a mage quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest attribute score, followed by Endurance or Agility. If you choose to join the school of Illusion, make Personality your next best score. Second, choose the sage background. Third, choose the mage hand, light, and ray of frost cantrips, along with the following 1st level spells for your spellbook: burning hands, charm person, feather fall, mage armor, and magic missile, and sleep.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>

      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>CLASS FEATURES</p>
      <p>As a Mage, you gain the following class features:</p>
      <p/>
      <p>HIT POINTS</p>
      <p>Hit Die: 1d6 per mage level</p>
      <p>Hit points at 1st Level: 6+ your Endurance modifier</p>
      <p>Hit points at Higher Levels: 1d6 (or 4) + your Endurance modifier per mage level after 1st </p>
      <p/>
      <p>PROFICIENCIES</p>
      <p>Armor: None</p>
      <p>Weapons: light crossbows, Short Blade and Staves</p>
      <p>Tools: none</p>
      <p>Saving Throws:  Intelligence, Willpower</p>
      <p>Skills: Pick two from: Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion</p>
      <p/>
      <p>EQUIPMENT</p>
      <p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>(a) a quarterstaff or (b) a dagger</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>(a) a scholar's pack or (b) an explorer's pack</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>a spellbook</p>
         </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <p/>
      <p>SPELLCASTING</p>
      <p>
         <p/>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the mage spell list. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>CANTRIPS</p>
      <p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the mage spell list. You learn additional mage cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Mage table.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SPELLBOOK</p>
      <p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level mage spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the mage spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</p>
      <p>The Mage table shows how much magicka you have to cast your mage spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend magicka, as noted in the spell's description and the Magicka Cost table found in chapter 10. You regain all expended magicka when you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p>You prepare the list of mage spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of mage spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your mage level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you can cast.</p>
      <p>For example, if you're a 3rd-level mage, you can cast a prepared spell at either 1st or 2nd level. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it at either 1st or 2nd level. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
      <p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of mage spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SPELLCASTING ATTRIBUTE</p>
      <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting attribute for your mage spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting attribute. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a mage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
      <p>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +</p>
      <p>your Intelligence modifier</p>
      <p>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +</p>
      <p>your Intelligence modifier</p>
      <p/>
      <p>RITUAL CASTING</p>
      <p>You can cast a mage spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>LEARNING SPELLS OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</p>
      <p>Each time you gain a mage level, you can add two mage spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you can cast, as shown on the Mage table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).</p>

                  <p>YOUR SPELLBOOK</p>
                  <p>The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the mundas. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>
                  <p>Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find a mage spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. </p>
                  <p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the mage who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you  understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. </p>
                  <p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. </p>
                  <p>Replacing the Book. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book – for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>
                  <p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many mages keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. </p>
                  <p>The Book's Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound glit-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>

      <p/>
      <p>MAGICAL FOCUS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 1st level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by Focus Points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>FOCUS POINTS</p>
      <p>You have 2 focus points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Focus Points column of the Mage table. You can never have more focus points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent focus points when finish a long rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>FLEXIBLE CASTING</p>
      <p>You can use your focus points to gain additional magicka, or sacrifice magicka to gain additional focus points. You learn other ways to use your focus points as you reach higher levels. </p>
      <p>Creating Magicka. You can transform unexpended focus points into one spell level worth of magicka as a bonus action on you turn. The Creating Magicka table shown the cost of creating magicka of a given spell level. You can create magicka no greater in spell level than 5th. </p>
      <p>Any magicka you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <p>ARCANE TRADITION</p>

      <p>METAMAGIC</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to focus your magic to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.</p>
      <p>You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless noted otherwise. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>CAREFUL SPELL</p>
      <p>When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. You spend 1 focus point and choose a number of creatures up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DISTANT SPELL</p>
      <p>When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can  spend 1 focus point to double the range of the spell.</p>
      <p>When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 focus point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>EMPOWERED SPELL</p>
      <p>When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 focus point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.</p>
      <p>You can use the Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different metamagic option during the casting of the spell.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>EXTENDED SPELL</p>
      <p>When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 focus point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>HEIGHTENED SPELL</p>
      <p>When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 focus points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>QUICKENED SPELL</p>
      <p>When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 focus points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>SUBTLE SPELL</p>
      <p>When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 focus point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>TWINNED SPELL</p>
      <p>When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of focus points equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 focus point if the spell is a cantrip). </p>
      <p>    To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level. For example, magic missile and scorching ray aren't eligible, but ray of frost and chromatic orb are. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>ATTRIBUTE SCORE IMPROVEMENT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one attribute score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two attribute scores of your choice by 1. As normal,  you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SPELL MASTERY</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 18th level, you have achieved such  mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st level mage spell and a 2nd level mage spell that you know. You can cast those two spells at their lowest level without expending magicka. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend magicka as normal. </p>
      <p>By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for a different spell of the same level.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SIGNATURE SPELLS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd level spells that you know as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending any magicka. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. </p>
      <p>If you want to cast either spell at a higher spell level, you must expend magicka as normal.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ARCANE TRADITIONS</p>
      <p>The study of magic is ancient, stretching back to the dawn of time. It is firmly established in the world of Nirn, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>
      <p>The most common arcane traditions in Tamriel revolve around the schools of magic. Mages through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into six categories, called schools, as described in chapter 10. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a mage might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Restoration. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even mages who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>SCHOOL OF ALTERATION</p>
      <p>
         <p/>The School of Alteration involves the manipulation of the physical world and its natural properties. Mastering alteration magicks requires an understanding of the fundamentals of nature, as the spells within are bound by nature's rules. </p>
      <p>Casting alteration spells is akin to convincing a greater power that it is easier to change reality than it is to leave it alone. Those that are familiar with this magick understand that expressing a spell as a subtle change, a diversion of nature's elements, is easier than creating it anew.</p>

      <p>ALTERATION PRODIGY</p>
      <p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must  spend to copy an alteration spell into your spellbook is halved.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ARCANE WARD</p>
      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can weave magic around yourself for protection. When you cast an alteration spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell’s magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has hit points equal to twice your mage level + your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.</p>
      <p>While the ward has 0 hit points, it can’t absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an alteration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell. </p>
      <p>Once you create the ward, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PROJECTED WARD</p>
      <p>Starting at 6th level, when a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that damage. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, the warded creature takes any remaining damage.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DAMPEN ELEMENTS</p>
      <p>Beginning at 10th level, when you or a creature within 30 feet of you takes acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, or poison, radiant, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to grant resistance to the creature against that instance of the damage.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SPELL RESISTANCE</p>
      <p>Starting at 14th level, you have advantage on saving throws against spells. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, you have resistance against the damage of spells.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SCHOOL OF CONJURATION</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Conjurers use their magical knowledge to open a connection to Oblivion. Centuries ago, the Direnni mages and sorcerers formalized many of the rituals, chants, and incantations that are still used today.</p>
      <p>When a mage uses conjuration magic, they create a connection from their mind to the summoned entity. It is a tenuous link, meant to lure, hold, and dismiss, but in the hand of a master, it becomes much stronger. </p>
      <p>Detractors of conjuration believe that the pursuit of summoning and control is desperate and dangerous, however, conjurers understand the risks of their power. As a mage of the School of Conjuration, you have learned how to summon powerful elemental daedra to serve as guardians and protectors, and sometimes as servants and familiars. Unlike the unpredictable dremora, the nonbelligerent atronachs are much more reliable servants, as they are not aligned with any daedric prince. </p>

      <p>CONJURATION PRODIGY</p>
      <p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must  spend to copy a conjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>MINOR CONJURATION</p>
      <p>Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can use your action to conjure up an inanimate object in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you. This object can be no larger than 3 feet on a side and weigh no more than 10 pounds, and its form must be that of a non-magical object that you have seen. The object is visibly magical, radiating dim light out to 5 feet. </p>
      <p>The object disappears after 1 hour, when you use this feature again, or if it takes any damage.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ATROMANCER</p>
      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you learn the exclusive conjuration spell Conjure Atronach.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Conjure Atronach</p>
      <p>Cast Time: 1 action</p>
      <p>Range: 5 feet</p>
      <p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
      <p>You summon a powerful daedric atronach that appears in an occupied space within range. The atronach disappears when it drops to 0 hit points, or when the spell ends. </p>
      <p>Roll initiative for the atronach, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the atronach, it defends itself from hostile creatures, but to otherwise takes no actions.</p>
      <p>As you gain mage levels you can summon more powerful companions. See the table below for the challenge rating of the type of creature you can summon. The spell level of the conjure atronach spell is determined by the challenge rating of the atronach summoned, as shown on the Mage Conjure Atronach table.</p>

      <p>ELEMENTAL BOND</p>
      <p>At 6th level, you share a bond with your conjured Atronach. While you summon an Atronach with your conjure atronach spell, you gain unique benefits based on the atronachs element. A cold-flame atronach can benefit from your choice of either the flame atronach or frost atronach feature, but not both.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Air &amp; Storm Atronach </p>
      <p>While you have an air or storm atronach companion, your speed increases by 10 feet.</p>
      <p>Additionally, you can fly in short bursts. You gain a fly speed equal to your walking speed. If your turn ends and you are not on a creature, solid object, or ground, you fall.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Earth, Stone, &amp; Iron Atronach</p>
      <p>While you have an earth, stone, or iron atronach companion, your skin assumes a stony appearance. If you aren't wearing armor, you gain a base AC of 13 + your Endurance modifier.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Flame Atronach </p>
      <p>While you have a flame atronach companion, a magical warmth surrounds you, keeping you warm as though you are near a campfire. As a bonus action, you can shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20-feet.</p>
      <p>Additionally, as an action, you can magically ignite a flammable object you touch with your hand – an object such as a torch, a piece of tinder, or the hem of drapes.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Flesh Atronach</p>
      <p>When you summon a flesh atronach companion, you gain 1d6 temporary hit points per challenge rating of the atronach summoned. These hit points vanish once the spell ends.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>Frost Atronach</p>
      <p>While you have a frost atronach companion, you gain the ability to walk on water.</p>
      <p>Additionally, you leave a 60-foot long trail of ice on the ground behind you. This trail is considered difficult terrain and any creature that tries to cross the path must succeed a DC 10 Agility saving throw or fall prone.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Water Atronach</p>
      <p>While you have a water atronach companion, you gain the ability to breathe under water, and you have a swim speed equal to your walking speed.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>FOCUSED CONJURATION</p>
      <p>Beginning at 10th level, while you are concentrating on a conjuration spell, your concentration can’t be broken as a result of taking damage. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>ELEMENTAL SOUL</p>
      <p>Starting at 14th Level, your elemental bond with your Atronach improves. While you have a conjured Atronach active, you also gain the following benefits:</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Flame Atronach </p>
      <p>While you have a flame atronach companion, you gain resistance to fire damage.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Frost &amp; Water Atronach</p>
      <p>While you have a frost or water atronach companion, you gain resistance to cold damage.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Earth, Stone, &amp; Iron Atronach</p>
      <p>While you have an earth, stone, or iron atronach companion, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</p>
      <p/>

      <p>While you have an air or storm atronach companion, you gain resistance to lightning and thunder damage.</p>

      <p>SCHOOL OF DESTRUCTION</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Mages of the School of Destruction express their magical power in a form that involves the harnessing of the natural elemental energies.</p>
      <p>Critics see destruction magic as crude and simplistic, whereas those who embrace the study of harnessing the destructive potential of magicka see their work as practical.</p>

      <p>DESTRUCTION PRODIGY</p>
      <p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must  spend to copy a destruction spell into your spellbook is halved.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ELEMENTAL MASTERY</p>
      <p>At 2nd level, you choose one type of element to have exceptional power over.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Cryomancer</p>
      <p>You prefer the cold of elemental frost, freezing your enemies in their tracks. Whenever a creature takes cold damage from a spell that you cast, the target's speed is also reduced by 15 feet until the end of your next turn. If the spell already reduces the target's speed, use whichever reduction is greater.</p>
      <p>When you reach 11th level, you reduce the target's speed by 20 feet.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Electromancer </p>
      <p>You are a natural with electricity, blasting your enemies with lightning. Each time you attack a creature with a spell that deals lightning or thunder damage, the target's magicka points are also reduced by 1d4. </p>
      <p>When you reach 11th level, you reduce the target's magicka by 1d6.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Pyromancer</p>
      <p>You have a gift for wielding fire, and you use it to burn your enemies to cinders. When you cast a spell that deals fire damage, you can reroll the lowest damage die. If the new roll is higher than the original, use it when calculating the damage. </p>
      <p>When you reach 11th level, you can reroll the lowest 2 damage rolls.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Venomancer</p>
      <p>You are most comfortable around deadly poisons, and can use it to disintegrate your enemies armor.</p>
      <p>The first time you deal acid or poison damage to a target, you reduce their AC by 1.  </p>
      <p>When you reach 11th level, the first time you deal acid or poison damage to a target, you reduce their AC by 2.</p>
      <p>This benefit has no effect on magical or natural armor.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>INESCAPABLE DESTRUCTION</p>
      <p>Starting at 6th level, the mage's ability to channel elemental energy becomes more potent. Any damage dealt by your Elemental Mastery ignores any resistance to that same elemental damage.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>EMPOWERED DESTRUCTION</p>
      <p>Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage roll of any destruction spell you cast.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>IMPROVED ELEMENTAL MASTERY</p>
      <p>At 14th level, you choose an additional Elemental Mastery. You can't choose the same mastery twice.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SCHOOL OF ILLUSION</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Illusion is a surprisingly useful school that is concerned with magicka's ability to alter the perception of objects without changing their physical compositions. By warping imperceptible energies, or removing sensual data, you can create darkness, extinguish light, and suppress sounds. </p>
      <p>While it might not be as flashy as the schools of destruction or alteration, illusion magic is not bound by the laws of nature as they are. Even if it is limited to only affecting the target and the caster, many are drawn to illusion for its ability to take ordinary objects and make them seem like something other than what they are.</p>

      <p>ILLUSION PRODIGY</p>
      <p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must  spend to copy a illusion spell into your spellbook is halved.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>IMPROVED MINOR ILLUSION</p>
      <p>When you choose this school at 2nd level, you learn the minor illusion cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different mage cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known.</p>
      <p>When you cast minor illusion, you can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of the spell.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>MALLEABLE ILLUSIONS</p>
      <p>Starting at 6th level, when you cast an illusion spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can use your action to change the nature of that illusion (using the spell’s normal pmeters for the illusion), provided that you can see the illusion.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ILLUSORY SELF</p>
      <p>Beginning at 10th level, you can create an illusory duplicate of yourself as an instant, almost instinctual reaction to danger. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to interpose the illusory duplicate between the attacker and yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates.</p>
      <p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ILLUSORY REALITY</p>
      <p>By 14th level, you have learned the secret of weaving shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semi-reality. When you cast an illusion spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose one inanimate, non-magical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a bonus action </p>
      <p>while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough for your allies to cross.</p>
      <p>The object can’t deal damage or otherwise directly harm anyone.</p>
      <p/>

      <p>SCHOOL OF MYSTICISM</p>
      <p>
         <p/>One of the oldest and yet least understood schools of magic is the school of Mysticism. These experiments with the most arcane aspects of magicka allows a mage to alter the nature of magic itself. </p>
      <p>The practice of mystical arts is considered to be chaotic in comparison to the far more predictable and ascertainable schools. Mysticism seems to derive power from its conundrums and pdoxes. The act of experimentation can influence magicka by its very existence.</p>
      <p>Students and philosophers of mysticism must be patient and dedicated to their art. The complicated and irrational aspects of this field of study make the development of new innovations much more gradual than other pursuits. It is said that mysticism requires the practitioner to divorce their mind from logic and embrace a temporary sort of insanity.</p>

      <p/>
      <p>SEER </p>
      <p>Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers you rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You choose to do so before your roll, and you can only replace a roll in this way only once per turn. </p>
      <p>Each foretelling roll can only be used once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused rolls. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>MYSTICISM EXPERT</p>
      <p>Beginning at 6th level, casting mysticism spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a mysticism spell of 2nd level or higher, you regain an amount of magicka points equal to the cost of a spell that is a lower level than the spell cast but can't be higher than 7 magicka points.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SIXTH SENSE</p>
      <p>Starting at 10th level, you can use your action to increase your powers of perception. When you do so, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you use this feature again, are incapacitated, or finish a short or long rest.</p>
      <p>Darkvision. You gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet, as described in chapter 8 in the Player's Handbook.</p>
      <p>Ethereal Sight. You can see into the Ethereal Plane within 60 feet of you.</p>
      <p>Greater Comprehension. You can read any language.</p>
      <p>See Invisibility. You can see invisible creatures and objects within 10 feet of you that are within line of sight.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ORACLE</p>
      <p>Starting at 14th level, the visions in your dreams intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind of what is to come. You roll three d20s for your Seer feature, rather than two.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SCHOOL OF RESTORATION</p>
      <p>
         <p/>The direct opposite of destruction, restoration magic focuses on resisting damage or restoring wholeness by reknitting the damaged material. Healers, priests, and clerics are usually well versed in the School of Restoration to aid the sick and weak.</p>
      <p>Restoration, as a school, goes beyond the singular curing of wounds and re-building of bones, but also includes preventing injury through powerful wards and bodily fortifications. Arguably, the greatest accomplishment of the restorative arts is the ability to cure curses, poisons, and disease, as entire civilizations were lost before the sages were able to discover a cure to such devastating plagues. </p>

      <p>RESTORATION PRODIGY</p>
      <p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must  spend to copy a restoration spell into your spellbook is halved.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>VIGOROUS HEALING</p>
      <p>Starting at 2nd level, your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>HEALING MIRROR </p>
      <p>Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spells level.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SPELL BREAKER</p>
      <p>Beginning at 10th level, when you restore hit points to an ally with a spell of 1st level or higher, you can also end one spell of your choice on that creature. The level of the spell you end must be equal to or lower than the level of the spell you cast for the healing spell.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>GRAND HEALING</p>
      <p>Starting at 14th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.</p>

      <p>MONK</p>
      <p>Her fists a blur as they deflect an incoming hail of arrows, a bosmer springs over a barricade and throws herself into the massed ranks of goblins on the other side. She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone. </p>
      <p>Taking a deep breath, a nord covered in tattoos settles into a battle stance. As the first charging orcs reach him, he exhales and a blast of fire roars from his mouth, engulfing his foes. </p>
      <p>Moving with the silence of the night, a black-clad khajiit steps into a shadow beneath an arch and emerges from another inky shadow on a balcony a stone’s throw away. She slides her blade free of its cloth-wrapped scabbard and peers through the open window at the tyrant prince, so vulnerable in the grip of sleep. </p>
      <p>Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>THE MAGIC OF STAMINA</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Monks make careful study of a magical energy that most monastic traditions call stamina. This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses the mundas – specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of stamina in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of stamina gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>TRAINING AND ASCETICISM</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Small walled cloisters dot the landscapes of Tamriel, tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand still. The monks who live there seek personal perfection through contemplation and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food couldn’t be found to support them, or in return for some kindness that the monks had performed for their families.</p>
      <p>Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other mortal or divine power. </p>
      <p>The majority of monks don’t shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or tyrants. </p>
      <p>For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don’t undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. As a rule, monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering their treasure. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>CREATING A MONK</p>
      <p>
         <p/>As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery’s threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself? </p>
      <p>Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community’s rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home? </p>
      <p>As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness stamina, monks are almost always lawful in alignment. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>QUICK BUILD</p>
      <p>You can make a monk quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Agility your highest attribute score, followed by Willpower. Second, choose the hermit background.</p>

      <p/>
      <p>EQUIPMENT</p>
      <p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>(a) a quarterstaff or (b) a hand-to-hand weapon</p>
         </listitem>

         </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <p>UNARMORED DEFENSE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10+ your Agility modifier + your Willpower modifier.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>MARTIAL ARTS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are hand-to-hand weapons, short blades, and staves that don't have the two-handed or heavy property. </p>
      <p>You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wearing a shield:</p>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>You can use Agility instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>you can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.</p>
         </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.</p>
         </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <p>Certain monstaries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kana). Whatever name you use for a  monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon in chapter 5, “Equipment.”</p>
      <p/>
      <p>STAMINA</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the energy of stamina. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of stamina points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Stamina Points column of the Monk table. </p>
      <p>You can spend these points to fuel various stamina features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more stamina features as you gain levels in this class.</p>
      <p>When you spend a stamina point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all your expended stamina back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your stamina points.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>Some of your stamina features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
      <p>Stamina Save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + </p>
      <p>your Willpower modifier</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Flurry of Blows</p>
      <p>Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn,  you can spend 1 stamina point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Patient Defense</p>
      <p>You can spend 1 stamina point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Step of the Wind</p>
      <p>You can spend 1 stamina point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>UNARMORED MOVEMENT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.</p>
      <p>At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>MONASTIC PATH</p>
      <p>
         <p/>When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a Monastic Path: the Way of the Exposed Palm, the Way of the Whispering Fang, or the Way of the Voice, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your path grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th,  11th , and 17th level.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>DEFLECT MISSILES</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Agility modifier + your monk level. </p>
      <p>If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 stamina point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile deals damage equal to your unarmed strike, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ATTRIBUTE SCORE IMPROVEMENT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one attribute score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two attribute scores of your choice by 1. As normal,  you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SLOW FALL</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>EXTRA ATTACK</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>STUNNING STRIKE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of stamina in an opponent's body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack,  you can spend 1 stamina point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on an Endurance saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>EMPOWERED STRIKES</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>EVASION</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make an Agility saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>STILLNESS OF MIND</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PURITY OF BODY</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 10th level, your stamina mastery makes you immune to disease and poison.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>TONGUES OF THE SOUL</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at the 13th level, you learn how to touch the minds of others so that you can understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>DIAMOND SOUL</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of stamina grants you proficiency in all saving throws. </p>
      <p>Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 stamina point to reroll it and take the second result.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>TIMELESS BODY</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 15th level, your stamina sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and can't be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>EMPTY BODY</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 stamina points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage. </p>
      <p>Additionally, you can spend 8 stamina points to cast the astral projection spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can't take any other creatures with you.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>PERFECT SELF</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no stamina points remaining, you regain 4 stamina points. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>MONASTIC PATH</p>
      <p>The traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries scattered across Nirn. Most monasteries practice one path exclusively, but a few honor multiple traditions and instruct each monk according to their aptitude and interest. Every monastery relies on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>WAY OF THE EXPOSED PALM</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Monks of the Way of the Exposed Palm understand how small objects can create more harm than larger ones. They tell of the pble of a person struck with the blunt side of a plate. The person is left with a small bruise, but is otherwise left unharmed. However, if the plate is broken, and the person is struck with one of the shards, the person may be grievously wounded. This is the first essential point of the Way of the Exposed Palm. </p>
      <p>Each finger on the hand represents a fundamental belief: concentration, reaction, equilibrium, speed, and breath control. To truly become a master of the Exposed Palm, one must perfect all five digits.</p>
      <p>In the pble of the plate, it tells the story of the first aspect of concentration. A blow that is concentrated into a small point becomes more potent. A highly trained fighter can be more deadly with just the thumb than to strike with the whole fist. </p>
      <p>The second aspect of concentration notes that with enough mental discipline, distraction can be ignored as the will maintains the ultimate goal. A truly deadly fighter can even block out their own pain.</p>

      <p>EXPOSED PALM TECHNIQUE</p>
      <p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy's stamina when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:</p>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>It must succeed on an Agility saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>It can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.</p>
         </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <p/>
      <p>COUNTERBALANCE</p>
      <p>A 6th level, you gain the ability to use stamina to absorb direct damage against you. As a reaction, when you are struck with an attack that only strikes you, and deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, you can reduce the damage by ten times the amount of stamina spent. Once you use this ability, you must finish a long rest to use it again.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>EXTRA ATTACK</p>
      <p>Beginning at 11th level, you can attack three times, instead of twice whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>QUIVERING PALM</p>
      <p>At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone's body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 stamina points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make an Endurance saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 bludgeoning damage. </p>
      <p>You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.</p>

      <p>WAY OF THE WHISPERING FANG</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Monks of the Way of the Whispering Fang follow an order shrouded in mystery. This monastic tradition has its origins deep in the jungles and deserts of Elsweyr. Here, the Khajiit perfected the deadly art of fang and claw.</p>
      <p>While the Khajiit make up the majority of the order, they are not racially exclusive. Races without the natural weapons of a khajiit, including the elven appearing Ohmes, learn the whispering fang's superior combat methods with the use of awls, katars, and daggers.</p>

      <p>MONK WEAPON MASTERY</p>
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, when you use monk weapons, you can choose to deal damage equal to the weapon's description, or by an amount equal to 1 size of dice larger than the your current martial arts die listed in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table. For example, at 3rd level instead of 1d4, your hand-to-hand weapon attacks deal 1d6 damage. At 17th level, your weapon attacks deal 1d12 damage.</p>
      <p>Special. If your race has natural weapons, they are considered monk weapons for you. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>WHOLENESS OF BODY</p>
      <p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CLOAK OF SHADOWS</p>
      <p>By 11th level, you have learned to become one with the shadows. When you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become invisible. You remain invisible until you make an attack, cast a spell, or are in an area of bright light.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>OPPORTUNIST</p>
      <p>At 17th level, you can exploit a creatures momentary distraction when it is hit by an attack. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack made by a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature. </p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>WAY OF THE VOICE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>The monks of High Hrothgar are the most famous practitioners of the Way of the Voice. These philosophical monks, known as the Greybeards, spend most of their time in silent meditation, isolated atop Skyrim's largest mountain. </p>
      <p>The Greybeards believe in using the Voice to attain enlightenment, rather than as a tool of war. This doesn't mean that they teach pacifism, only that the Voice can be used more more than just simple violence. They believe that those who can wield the Voice should only do so in times of True Need.</p>

      <p>DISCIPLE OF THE VOICE</p>
      <p>When you choose this path at 3rd level, you learn how to harness the power of the dragon tongue to form powerful shouts. A shout requires you to spend stamina points each time you use it.</p>
      <p>Shouts. You know the Unrelenting Force shout and one other shout of your choice, which are detailed in the “Dragon Shouts” section below. You learn two additional shout of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p>
      <p>Whenever you learn a new shout, you can also replace one shout that you already know with a different shout.</p>
      <p>Using Dragon Shouts. The Thu'um is a form of magic which uses words from the draconic language to form powerful shouts. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don't need to use any magicka to cast it.</p>
      <p>Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional stamina points to increase the level of a Dragon Shout spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as unrelenting force does. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional stamina point you spend. </p>
      <p>The maximum number of stamina points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base stamina point cost and any additional stamina points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the Spells and Shouts table.</p>

      <p>Some of your Dragon Shout features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
      <p>Dragon Shout save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Willpower modifier </p>
      <p/>
      <p>DRAGON SHOUTS</p>
      <p>The dragon shouts are presented at the level you must be to learn them.</p>
      <p/>

      <p>You can spend 1 stamina point to throw your voice anywhere within 60 feet of you. You can use your voice to distract or confuse others. Each creature must make a Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is fooled by this trick, and is not fooled on a successful save.</p>
      <p>You can also use your voice to make an ally appear to insult a target, if the target is capable of understanding your language. On a failed save, the creature has disadvantage on any attacks against targets other than the suspected taunter.

      <p>If you sense life in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature in the area that bears life. </p>
      <p>The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Disarm (Zun Haal Viik)</p>
      <p>You can use 2 stamina points to use your voice to focus vibrations on a weapon currently being wielded by a creature within 30 feet. The creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature drops their weapon. On a successful save, the creature has disadvantage on any attacks made with that weapon until the start of your next turn.</p>
      <p>If a creature tries to pick up a dropped weapon, they must use half their speed and make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is incapable of picking up the weapon. On a successful save, the creature is able to pick up the weapon and the effect ends. </p>

      <p>The target must make a Strength saving throw to resist the spell. On a failed save, the target takes 4d8 cold damage and they are encased in a shell of frost. The encased creature is immobilized and can't speak, hear, move, or make any actions. The creature takes this damage again on each subsequent turn while the spell persists.</p>
      <p>The creature restrained by this spell must make another Strength saving throw at the start of each of their turns to try and break free. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, the frost hardens and the creature is subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind. </p>
      <p>On a successful save, the creature takes half of much damage and isn't immobilized. </p>
      <p>While the spell is active, the frost shell has an AC of 5 and has 60 hit points. When the frost shell reaches 0 hit points, the shell breaks, ending the spell effect. A dispel magic spell can also reverse the effects.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>

      <p/>

      <p/>
      <p>Return to Nirn (Nahl Dal Vus)</p>
      <p>You can spend 9 stamina points to travel instantly from any plane that you are currently on and return to Nirn. You and up to 10 willing creatures can choose to return to a specific location that you have seen before. If you are currently on Nirn, this spell automatically fails.</p>

      <p/>
      <p>NIGHTBLADE</p>
      <p>Unexpectedly, the viscount blurts out the location of the missing dauphin, when moments earlier he seemed disinterested in helping. With a wave of her hand, an altmer smiles slyly, thanks the aid, and confidently leaves the castle. </p>
      <p>Suppressing a giggle, a breton waggles her fingers and magically lifts the key ring from the guard’s belt. In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and she and her companions are free to make their escape.</p>
      <p>Navigating the dark alleys in near silence, an argonian dressed in black dyed leather heads towards the back side of the mayor's villa. Noticing an open window on the second-story, he fades into the shadows and with a puff of black smoke reappears in the unlit room.</p>
      <p>Every nightblade has given themselves to the shadow, exploiting the ancient magic found within the darkness. They use the arcane arts to enhance their skills of stealth and to manipulate the minds of others.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>MISCHIEVOUS OPPORTUNISTS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Whichever path they choose, nightblades have a sinister reputation that follows. They are known to be clever pickpockets and burglars, but also pranksters and mischief-makers. Not all nightblades are scoundrels, however. Many use their talents to become incredibly successful investigators, undercover operatives, or royal inquisitors.</p>
      <p>When it comes to getting in and out unnoticed, nightblades are unrivaled. They're natural talent with stealth, combined with magical concealment means a capable nightblade is hardly ever seen. Unlike studious mages, nightblades supplement their magic with their skillful blade and light armor.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CONFLICT AND MISFORTUNE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>The life of a nightblade is a dangerous one. Whatever their motivations, slinking through alleyways, spying on suspects, and liberating goods is a risky business. Sometimes considered agents of misery, most nightblades have become inured to the woe's of others, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they are unaffected by their actions.</p>
      <p>Typically driven by the need to learn more about the dark arts of shadow magic, or to discover the inner workings of black markets, nightblades often find themselves flirting on the edge of morality to get what they want.</p>
      <p>CREATING A NIGHTBLADE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>As you create your nightblade character, consider it's relationship with the shadow. Have you completely given in to the darkness are do you skirt around the edges, taking only what you need? Do you struggle with the harmful magic, or have you learned to balance the dangerous power? Perhaps you believe that light shines brightest in the darkness and use this gift to fend off the forces of evil.</p>
      <p>What was your life like before you started your adventure? Were you a lowly thief or an esteemed agent of the Empire? Or maybe you started out as a illusionist and realized you can use your magic prowess to take what you want. How did you learn about the obscure shadow magic? Were you selected by a mentor who noticed your talents or did you happen across a mystic tome during a heist? </p>
      <p>Consider why you've joined a group of adventurers. Are you in search of more powerful knowledge that you can't manage on your own? Does your greed drive you, are you interested in honing your skills, or are you investigating nefarious villains. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>QUICK BUILD</p>
      <p>You can make a nightblade quickly by following these suggestions. First, Personality should be your highest attribute score, followed by Endurance. Second, use the charlatan background. Third, choose the chill touch and eldritch blast cantrips, along with with 1st level spells charm person and witch bolt.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CLASS FEATURES</p>
      <p>As a nightblade, you gain the following class features.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>HIT POINTS</p>
      <p>Hit Dice: 1d8 per nightblade level</p>
      <p>Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Endurance modifier</p>
      <p>Hit Points At higher levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Endurance modifier per nightblade level after 1st</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PROFICIENCIES</p>
      <p>Armor: Light armor</p>
      <p>Weapons: Marksman, Short Blade, and Long Blade</p>

      <p>SPELLCASTING</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Your arcane research grants you the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the nightblade spell list.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CANTRIPS</p>
      <p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the nightblade spell list. You learn additional nightblade cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Nightblade table.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>MAGICKA</p>
      <p>The Nightblade table shows how much magicka you have to cast your nightblade spells of 1st level and higher.  The table also shows what the level spells you can cast. To cast one of your nightblade spells of 1st level or higher, must expend magicka, as noted in the spell's description and the Magicka Cost table found in chapter 10. You regain all expended magicka when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
      <p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell witch bolt and have a Spell Level of 2nd, you can cast witch bolt using magicka to cast it at either level.</p>
      <p>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</p>
      <p>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the nightblade spell list.</p>
      <p>The Spells Known column of the Nightblade table shows when you learn more nightblade spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table's Spell Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new nightblade spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p>
      <p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the nightblade spells you know and replace it with another spell from the nightblade spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>SPELLCASTING ATTRIBUTE</p>
      <p>Personality is your spellcasting attribute for your nightblade spells, so you use your Personality whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting attribute. In addition, you use your Personality modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a nightblade spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
      <p>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +</p>
      <p>your Personality modifier</p>
      <p>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +</p>
      <p>your Personality modifier</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PATH OF DARKNESS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 1st level, choose a path of darkness, which describes your devotion as a nightblade. Choose either Betrayer, Deathless, Seeker, Shadowmage, or Trickster, which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your path grants you features at 1st level, and then again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CUNNING ACTION</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allows you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SHADOWHAND</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 2nd level, you learn the mage hand cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different cantrip of your choice from the nightblade spell list. This cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known. </p>
      <p>When you cast mage hand, you can make the spectral hand invisible, and you can perform the following additional tasks with it:</p>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>You can stow one object the hand is holding in a container worn or carried by another creature.</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>You can retrieve an object in a container worn or carried by another creature.</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>You can use thieves’ tools to pick locks and disarm traps at range.</p>
         </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <p>You can perform one of these tasks without being noticed by a creature if you succeed on an Agility (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the creature’s Willpower (Perception) check. </p>
      <p>In addition, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to control the hand.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>NIGHTEYE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 3rd level, you have naturally adjusted to being in darkness. You gain darkvision and can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ATTRIBUTE SCORE IMPROVEMENT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one attribute score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two attribute scores by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SHADOW STEP</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 5th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. Additionally, you can teleport into a shadow cast by another creature within range when you are not in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee attack you make before the end of your turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>MAGICAL AMBUSH </p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 9th level, if you are hidden from a creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the spell this turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>NIGHT MAGIC</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 11th level, your continued research in the esoteric studies of shadow magic has unlocked an arcane secret known as night magic. Choose one 6th-level spell from the nightblade spell list. You can cast this unique spell once without expending any magicka. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>
      <p>At higher levels, you gain more nightblade spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Night Magic spells when you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>VERSATILE TRICKSTER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 13th level, you gain the ability to distract targets with your mage hand. As a bonus action on your turn, you can designate a creature within 5 feet of the spectral hand created by the spell. Doing so gives you advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the end of the turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SPELL THIEF</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 18th level, you gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster.</p>
      <p>Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a saving throw with it's spellcasting attribute modifier. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell if it is at least 1st level and of a level that you can cast (it doesn't need to be a nightblade spell). For the next 8 hours, you know the spell and can cast it, using magicka as normal. The creature can't cast that spell until 8 hours have passed. </p>
      <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SHADE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>When you reach 20th level, you have mastered the dark arts of shadow magic, allowing you to call into the shadow realms and bring forth your own shadow. As a bonus action on your turn, you can summon a shadowy version of yourself which appears from your shadow. This creature shares all of your statistics, including your current hit points, and is wearing the same equipment as you. The shade can communicate with you telepathically, knows everything that you know, and shares your alignment, background, and motivations. The shade disappears when it drops to 0 hit points, or you use a bonus action to dismiss it back to the shadow realm.</p>
      <p>As a part of your turn, you can direct the shade to move a distance equal to your speed. You can also direct the shade to make one weapon attack.</p>
      <p>Additionally, as a bonus action on your turn, you can swap places with your shade, as long as you are within 60 feet of each other.</p>
      <p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>PATH OF DARKNESS</p>
      <p>Nightblades devote themselves to ancient and obscure magic which blurs the lines of morality. The path they choose determines how much of the darkness is embraced.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DEATHLESS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Those that are considered Deathless have uncovered mystical secrets to weave shadow magic into their illusions, blurring the lines between life and death.</p>
      <p>With goals of reaching immortality, the Deathless attempt to fend off death, both for themselves and others. Those that master the shadow see generations pass in a single lifetime. </p>

      <p/>
      <p>AMONG THE DEAD</p>
      <p>Starting at 1st level, you learn the spare the dying cantrip, which counts as a nightblade cantrip for you. You also have advantage on saving throws against disease.</p>
      <p>Additionally, undead have difficulty harming you. If an undead targets you directly with an attack or a harmful spell, that creature must make a Willpower saving throw against your spell save DC (an undead needn't make the save when it includes you in an area effect, such as the explosion of fireball). On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or forfeit targeting someone instead of you, potentially wasting the attack or spell. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. An undead is also immune to this effect for 24 hours if you target it with an attack or a harmful spell.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DEFY DEATH</p>
      <p>Starting at 6th level, you can give yourself vitality when you cheat death or when you help someone else cheat it. You regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your Endurance modifier (minimum of 1 hit point) when you succeed on a death saving throw or when you stabilize a creature with spare the dying.</p>
      <p>Once you use this feature,  you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>UNDYING NATURE</p>
      <p>Beginning at 10th level, you can hold your breath indefinitely, and you don't require food, water, or sleep, although you still require rest to reduce exhaustion and still benefit from finishing short and long rests.</p>
      <p>In addition, you age at a slower rate. For every 10 years that pass, you body only ages 1 year, and you are immune to being magically aged.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>INDESTRUCTIBE LIFE</p>
      <p>When you reach 14th level, you partake of some of the true secrets of the deathless. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your nightblade level. Additionally, if you put a severed body part of yours back in place when you use this feature, the part reattaches. </p>
      <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.    </p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>SHADOWMAGE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>With skill and patience, Shadowmages can read the shadows, manipulating them and the object or force that cast it. Students of the shadow have learned how to “peer sidewise” to perceive the shadows cast by each entity and object in the Aurbis. Of course, these are not literal shadows, but the emanation of the limen each object possesses. </p>
      <p>Through their learning and focus on the hyperagonal sense, the shadowmage becomes skilled at instant translocation. They can step through the shdaows, almost as a matter of reflex. </p>
      <p>Another use for the shadowmage' s prowess in magical translocation is ability to create a trasliminal flow of essence from their adversaries. This malicious shadow draining allows the mage to absorb the life essence of others. </p>

      <p>DRAIN ESSENCE</p>
      <p>Starting at 1st level, your study of the dark arts allows you to extract vitality from another creature as it nears its demise. When you reduce a creature within 5 feet of you to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Personality modifier + your nightblade level (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>CHILD OF DARKNESS</p>
      <p>Also at 1st level, you find yourself being the most comfortable while surrounded in darkness. While you are in dim light, darkness, or magical darkness, you gain the following benefits:</p>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>You ignore difficult terrain.</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>You have advantage on initiative rolls.</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>On your first turn during combat, you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that have not yet acted.</p>
         </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <p/>
      <p>SHADOWY ESCAPE</p>
      <p>Starting at 6th level, you can vanish in a puff of smoke in response to harm. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell.</p>
      <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CLOAK OF SHADOWS</p>
      <p>By 10th level, you have learned to become one with the shadows. When you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become invisible. You remain invisible until you make an attack, cast a spell, or are in an area of bright light.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DELERIUM</p>
      <p>Starting at 14th level, you can plunge a creature into an illusory shadow realm. As an action, choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. It must make a Willpower saving throw against your nightblade spell save DC. On a failed save, it is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). This effect ends early if the creature takes any damage. </p>
      <p>Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in a shadow realm, the appearance of which you choose. The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and the illusion.</p>
      <p>You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again.</p>

      <p>TRICKSTER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Tricksters use illusion to magically entrance and beguile other creatures. Whether they use their skills to become peacemakers who bewitch the violent to lay down their arms, or become tyrants who magically bind the unwilling into their service, Tricksters rely on manipulating the minds of others.</p>

      <p>DARK PRESENCE</p>
      <p>Starting at 1st level, you have the ability to project the beguiling and fearsome presence of the darkness. As an action, you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Willpower saving throw against your nightblade spell save DC. The creatures that fail their saving throws are all charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn.</p>
      <p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>ENTROPIC WARD</p>
      <p>At 6th level, you learn to magically ward yourself against attack and to turn an enemy’s failed strike into good luck for yourself. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that roll. If the attack misses you, your next attack roll against the creature has advantage if you make it before the end of your next turn. </p>
      <p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SHADOWY DEFENSES</p>
      <p>Beginning at 10th level, your learn how to turn the mind-affecting magic of your enemies against them. You are immune to being charmed, and when another creature attempts to charm you, you can use your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on that creature. The creature must succeed on a Willpower saving throw against your nightblade spell save DC or be charmed by you for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>MIND TAKING</p>
      <p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to make a creature unaware of your magical influence on it. When you cast a spell or use an ability to charm one or more creatures, you can alter one creature's understanding so that it remains unaware that it is being charmed.</p>
      <p>Additionally, once before the spell or effect expires, you can use your action to try to modify the chosen creature's memory of some of the time it spent while charmed. The creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against your nightblade spell save DC. On a failed save, you can modify a number of hours of its memories equal to 1 + your Personality modifier (minimum 1). You can choose to modify less time if desired, and the amount of time can't exceed the duration of your illusion spell.</p>
      <p>A modified memory doesn’t necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature’s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner. </p>

      <p>SEEKER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Seekers search for knowledge, traveling through the world, collecting lore, and unlocking ancient magic lost to the ages. They use enshrouding darkness and gain access to shadowy pocket realms to protect themselves and their allies from the harms of the Mundas. </p>
      <p>While most seekers uncover the secrets of the gloam through study and discovery of the arcane, these powers can be fast-tracked with the aid of more powerful beings. Seekers may be worshipers of the Daedra Princes whose spheres are of knowledge and shadow. Hermaeus Mora and Nocturnal are sometimes willing to sponsor acolytes and students who can prove their potential.</p>

      <p>SHIELDING AURA</p>
      <p>Starting at 1st level, you can invoke shadow magic to protect you from harm. As a bonus action, you create a whirling aura of dark energy that swirls around you. Until the end of your next turn, you gain resistance to all damage, and if a hostile creature ends its turn within 10 feet of you, it takes necrotic damage equal to your nightblade level + your Personality modifier.</p>

      <p>SHADOW REFUGE</p>
      <p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to step into a shadow refuge. As an action, you disappear from the world for a brief moment and enter the Shadow Realm, taking advantage of its timeless nature. While in your shadow refuge, you can take two actions to cast spells that target only you. After using those two actions, you return to the space you occupied and your turn ends. </p>

      <p>At 10th level, you no longer need to breathe, and you gain resistance to fire damage and cold damage.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>UMBRAL SEQUESTRATION</p>
      <p>Starting at 14th level, you gain the ability to sequester yourself and your allies in the Shadow Realm</p>
      <p>By performing a special ritual over the course of 5 minutes, you shift yourself and up to ten willing creatures you can see to the Shadow Realm. You and those creatures gain the benefits of a short rest while sequestered on the Shadow Realm. You then return to the spaces you all occupied when you used this ability, with no time having passed in the world. </p>
      <p>During this short rest, you and the creatures you sequester can make use of any options available during a rest that affect only you and the creatures you sequester. </p>
      <p>Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>BETRAYER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Betrayers use their knowledge and magic to uncover secrets and turn them against others through extortion and threats. Nightblades are often looked upon with suspicion and distrust, usually with ample justification. This, of course, isn't true of all Nightblades.  </p>
      <p>Nightblades who follow the path of the Betrayer, however, often hide their true nature. They typically claim to have developed their magic through more palatable means, as shadow magic is generally seen as nefarious, especially when it involves bending ones will. They might also keep their actual calling secret in order to infiltrate and exploit royal courts and other settings of power.</p>

      <p>VENOMOUS BLADES </p>
      <p>Starting at 1st level when you choose this path, you gain the ability to magically make your weapon attacks toxic for a moment. </p>
      <p>Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can deal an extra 1d6 poison damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. </p>
      <p>You don't need advantage on an attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll. </p>
      <p>The additional damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 10th level, and 4d6 at 15th level.</p>

      <p/>
      <p>VENOMOUS WORDS </p>
      <p>At 6th level, you learn to infuse innocent seeming words with an insidious magic. A creature that hears you speak can become plunged into fear and pnoia. </p>
      <p>If you speak to a humanoid alone for at least 10 minutes, you can attempt to seed pnoia and fear into its mind. At the end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a Willpower saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened for the next hour, until it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged. While frightened in this way, the target is pnoid and tries to avoid the company of others, including its allies. The target seeks out what it considers the safest, most secret place available to it and hides there. </p>
      <p>If the target succeeds on its save, the target has no hint that you tried to frighten it. </p>
      <p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short rest or long rest. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>MANTLE OF WHISPERS </p>
      <p>At 10th level, you gain the ability to adopt a creature’s persona. When you slay a creature with an attack or a spell or a creature dies within 5 feet of you, you can magically capture its shadow using your reaction. You can capture only the shadow of a creature that is your creature type, such as humanoid, and your size (you can capture a Small or Medium shadow if you’re Small), and you can have only one shadow captured at a time. </p>
      <p>After you capture a creature’s shadow, you can use your magic to weave it into a disguise that allows you to take on its appearance and gain access to its surface memories. As an action, you take on the creature’s appearance for 1 hour or until you end this effect as a bonus action. </p>
      <p>During that hour, you gain access to all information that the creature would freely share with a casual acquaintance. Information includes general details on its background and personal life, but does not include secrets. The information is enough that you can pass yourself off as the creature by drawing on its memories. </p>
      <p>Another creature can see through this disguise by making a Willpower (Insight) check opposed by your Personality (Deception) check, though you gain a +5 bonus to your check. </p>
      <p>The disguise and the knowledge it grants disappears when this ability’s duration ends. </p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>SHADOW LORE </p>
      <p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to weave dark magic into your words and tap into a creature’s deepest fears. </p>
      <p>As an action, you magically whisper a phrase that only one creature of your choice within 30 feet of you can hear. The target must make a Willpower saving throw against your spell save DC. It automatically succeeds if it doesn’t share a language with you or if it can’t hear you. On a successful saving throw, your whisper sounds like unintelligible mumbling and has no effect. </p>
      <p>If the target fails its saving throw, it is charmed by you for the next 8 hours or until you or your allies attack or damage it. It interprets the whispers as a description of its most mortifying secret. While you gain no knowledge of this secret, the target is convinced you know it. </p>
      <p>While charmed in this way, the creature obeys your commands for fear that you will reveal its secret. It won’t risk its life for you or fight for you, unless it was already inclined to do so. It grants you favors and gifts it would offer to a close friend. </p>
      <p>When the effect ends, the creature has no understanding of why it held you in such fear. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. </p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>RANGER</p>
      <p>Rough and wild looking, a breton stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a short sword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.</p>
      <p>After tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, a bosmer finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon’s thick scales.</p>
      <p>Holding his hand high, a redguard whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Yoku, he points to the bear he’s been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.</p>
      <p>Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DEADLY HUNTERS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization – humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes. A ranger’s talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands. </p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>INDEPENDENT ADVENTURERS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger’s true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with warden conclaves. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first – and possibly the last line of defense. </p>
      <p>This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization’s foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>CREATING A RANGER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger’s ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain – perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a warden conclave, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and have a connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds. </p>
      <p>What’s the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?</p>
      <p/>
      <p>QUICK BUILD</p>
      <p>You can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Agility your highest attribute score, followed by Endurance. (Some rangers who choose two-weapon fighting may prefer Strength over Agility.) Second, choose the outlander background.</p>
      <p>CLASS FEATURES</p>
      <p> As a Ranger, you gain the following class features</p>
      <p/>
      <p>HIT POINTS</p>
      <p>Hit Dice: 1d10 per ranger level</p>
      <p>Hit Points at 1st Level: 10 + your Endurance modifier</p>
      <p>Hit Points At higher levels: 1d10 (or 6) + your Endurance modifier per ranger level after 1st</p>

      <p>FAVORED ENEMY</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy commonly encountered in the wilds.</p>
      <p>Choose a type of favored enemy: beasts, humanoids, monstrosities, or undead. You gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with weapon attacks against creatures of the chosen type. Additionally, you have advantage on Willpower (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.</p>
      <p>When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice, typically one spoken by your favored enemy or creatures associated with it. However, you are free to pick any language you wish to learn. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>NATURAL EXPLORER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>You are a master of navigating the natural world, and you react with swift and decisive action when attacked. This grants you the following benefits:</p>

         </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <p>FIGHTING STYLE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ARCHERY</p>
      <p>You gain a +2 bonus to your attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DEFENSE</p>
      <p>While wearing armor, you gain +1 bonus to AC.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DUELING</p>
      <p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING</p>
      <p>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SKIRMISHER'S STEALTH</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Beginning at 2nd level, you combine speed and stealth in combat to make yourself hard to pin down. You are difficult to detect even if you attack or otherwise take actions that would normally reveal your presence.</p>
      <p>At the start of your turn, pick a creature you are hidden from. You remain hidden from that creature during your turn, regardless of your actions or the actions of other creatures. As a bonus action at the end of your turn, you can make an Agility (Stealth) check to hide from that creature again if you fulfill the conditions needed to hide. Otherwise, creatures are aware of you at the end of your turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>POULTICES</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 3rd level, you can create special herbal poultices that have healing power compble to some potions. You can spend 1 hour gathering herbs and preparing herbal poultices using treated bandages to create a number of such poultices equal to your Willpower modifier (minimum 1). You can carry a number of poultices at one time equal to your Willpower modifier (minimum 1). The poultices you create cannot be applied by anyone but you. After 24 hours, any poultices that you have not used lose their potency.</p>
      <p>If you spend 1 minute applying one of your poultices to a wounded humanoid creature, thereby expending its use, that creature regains 1d6 hit points for every two ranger levels you have (rounded up).</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PRIMAL INSTINCTS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Beginning at 3rd level, your mastery of ranger lore allows you to establish a powerful link to beasts and to the land around you. With this feature you gain the following benefits:</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PRIMAL CONTACT</p>
      <p>You have an innate ability to communicate with beasts, and they recognize you as a kindred spirit. Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas to a beast as an action, and can read its basic mood and intent. You learn its emotional state, whether it is affected by magic of any sort, its short-term needs (such as food or safety), and actions you can take (if any) to persuade it to not attack.</p>
      <p>You cannot use this ability against a creature that you have attacked within the past 10 minutes.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PRIMEVAL AWARENESS</p>
      <p>You can attune your senses to determine if any of your favored enemies lurk nearby. By spending 1 uninterrupted minute in concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), you can sense whether any of your favored enemies are present within 5 miles of you. This feature reveals which of your favored enemies are present, their numbers, and the creatures’ general direction and distance (in miles) from you.</p>
      <p>If there are multiple groups of your favored enemies within range, you learn this information for each group.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PRIMAL MARK</p>
      <p>As a bonus action, you can choose a creature you can see within 90 feet of you and mark it as your quarry for up to 1 hour, as though you are concentrating on a spell. You have advantage on any Willpower (Perception) or Willpower (Survival) check you make to find it. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>RANGER ARCHETYPE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Archer, Hunter, or Scout, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ATTRIBUTE SCORE IMPROVEMENT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one attribute score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two attribute scores by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>EXTRA ATTACK</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>GREATER FAVORED ENEMY</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 6th level, you are ready to hunt even deadlier game. Choose a type of greater favored enemy: Fiends, Constructs, Dragons, Elementals, or Giants. You gain all the benefits against this chosen enemy that you normally gain against your favored enemy, including an additional language. Your bonus to damage rolls against all your favored enemies increases to +4.</p>
      <p>Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against the spells and abilities used by a greater favored enemy.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>FLEET OF FOOT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Beginning at 8th level, you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>NATURAL ANTIVENOM</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on saving throws against poison and have resistance to poison damage. Additionally, you can use one of your poultices each day to cure one poison effect on the creature you are applying it to, in addition to restoring hit points.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>HIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 10th level, you can remain perfectly still for long periods of time to set up ambushes. </p>
      <p>When you attempt to hide on your turn, you can opt to not move on that turn. If you avoid moving, creatures that attempt to detect you take a −10 penalty to their Willpower (Perception) checks until the start of your next turn. You lose this benefit if you move or fall prone, either voluntarily or because of some external effect. You are still automatically detected if any effect or action causes you to no longer be hidden.</p>
      <p>If you are still hidden on your next turn, you can continue to remain motionless and gain this benefit until you are detected.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CALL NATURAL ALLIES</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 13th level, you can call natural creatures from your current terrain to fight on your behalf, using your attunement to the natural world to convince them to aid you. The DM chooses beasts appropriate to the terrain to come to your aid from among those that could hear you and that are within 1 mile of you, in one of the following groups:</p>
      <p>    These beasts approach you from their current location, and will fight alongside you, attacking any creatures that are hostile to you. They are friendly to you and your allies, and you roll initiative for the called creatures as a group, which takes its own turns. The DM has the creatures’ statistics.</p>
      <p>After 1 hour, these beasts return to their previous location. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again in the same general area for 24 hours, since the same animals will not repeatedly heed your call.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>VANISH</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 14th level you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can never be tracked by non-magical means, unless you intended to leave a trail.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PRIMAL CONNECTION</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 17th level, you become one with nature and gain a nearly supernatural connection to it, unlocking it's knowledge and secrets.</p>
      <p>If you spend 1 minute in uninterrupted meditation while outdoors, you gain knowledge of the land within 3 miles of you. In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. You don't gain this knowledge in areas where nature has been replaced by construction, such as dungeons and towns.</p>
      <p>You instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:</p>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>terrain and bodies of water</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>influence from other planes of existence</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>buildings</p>
         </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <p>For example, you could determine the location of powerful undead in the area, the location of major sources of safe drinking water, and the location of any nearby towns.</p>
      <p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>FERAL SENSES</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. </p>
      <p>You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>FOE SLAYER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 20th level, you become an unplleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you add your willpower modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against a favored enemy. You can choose to use the feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>RANGER ARCHETYPE</p>
      <p>The ideal ranger has three classic expressions, the Archer, the Hunter, and the Scout.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ARCHER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Archers are fighters who have focused their training to specialize in long-range combat. While any warrior with a bow can be considered an archer, rangers develop a form of unmatched discipline and prowess with all forms of  projectiles. Archers perform the best when they can keep their opponents at a distance, using ranged weapons and swift maneuvers. Once engaged in melee, they strike deftly, using swords and axes to bring down the wounded and weary. </p>

      <p>COMBAT TACTICS</p>
      <p>At 3rd level, you learn combat tactics that are fueled by special dice called tactical dice.</p>
      <p>Tactics. You learn two tactics of your choice, which are detailed under “Combat Tactics” below. Many tactics enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one tactic per attack.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>You learn one additional tactic of your choice at 7th, 11th, and 15th levels. Each time you learn a new tactic, you can also replace one tactic you know with a different one.</p>
      <p>Tactical Dice. You have four tactical dice, which are d8s. A tactical die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended tactical dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
      <p>You gain another tactical die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.</p>
      <p>Saving Throws. Some of your tactics require your target to make a saving throw to resist the tactic’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
      <p>Tactic save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + </p>
      <p>your Strength or Agility modifier (your choice)</p>
      <p/>
      <p>IRON MIND</p>
      <p>By 7th level, your time studying beasts and the focus required by archery has stilled your mind. You gain proficiency in Willpower saving throws and have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ARCHER'S MASTERY</p>
      <p>At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice:</p>
      <p>Critical Shot. Your keen eye can find your foes' most vulnerable weaknesses. Your ranged weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20.</p>
      <p>Flurry. If you miss with an attack during your turn, you can immediately make an additional attack. You can gain one additional attack during your turn with this ability.</p>
      <p>Quick Shot. During the first round of combat, you can use your reaction to make a weapon attack. This attack occurs at your initiative plus 10.</p>
      <p>Scatter Shot. When another creature damages you with a melee weapon attack, you use your reaction to  move up to half your movement speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the creature. You can then make a quick weapon attack against that same creature with the same reaction.</p>
      <p>Steady Hand. You gain advantage on one attack roll you make with a ranged weapon each turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>RELENTLESS</p>
      <p>Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no tactical dice remaining, you regain 1 tactical die.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>COMBAT TACTICS</p>
      <p>The tactics are presented in alphabetical order. </p>
      <p>Counter. When another creature attacks you, you can use your reaction and expend one tactical die to increase your AC by the number you roll on your tactical die, until the start of your next turn. The attack misses if it fails to hit with your new AC value.</p>
      <p>Disarming Attack. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.</p>
      <p>Distracting Strike. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.</p>
      <p>Dodge Roll. When a creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one tactical die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your tactical die + your Agility modifier.</p>
      <p>Evasive footwork. When you move, you can expend one tactical die, rolling the die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.</p>
      <p>Knockdown. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.</p>
      <p>Maneuvering Attack. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to maneuver one of your allies into a more advantageous position. You add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use it's reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>Overdraw. When you make a ranged attack, you can expend one tactical die to double the range of the weapon without causing disadvantage. If you hit, you add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll.</p>
      <p>Pierce Armor. When you hit a creature that is wearing armor with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to weaken their armor, reducing the targets AC by 1. If you hit, you add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll. You can not weaken the same armor more than once.</p>
      <p>Power Shot. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to throw the attacker off balance. You add the tactical die roll to the attack's damage roll, and it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it is staggered and has disadvantage on their next attack.</p>
      <p>Precision Attack. When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one tactical die to add a tactical die to the roll. You can use this tactic before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.</p>
      <p>Pushing Attack. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the tactical die roll to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it is pushed back 15 feet.</p>
      <p>Split Shot. When you make a ranged weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to damage another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your tactical die. The damage is of the same type dealt for the original attack.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>HUNTER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>The life of a hunter is spent tracking prey and training to become the best predator of all. Emulating the Hunter archetype means that they have reached the upper echelon of their pursuits. Using daedric magic, the hunter tries to earn Hircine's favour and achieve a place in the Great Hunt.</p>

      <p>COMPANION OF HIRCINE</p>
      <p>At 3rd level, you learn how to conjure a powerful beast from The Hunting Grounds, Hircine's plane of Oblivion.</p>
      <p>With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 200 septims worth of magical components, you call forth a daedric beast from the Hunting Grounds to serve as your faithful companion. You normally select your companion from among the following animals: an ape, a black bear, a boar, a giant badger, a giant weasel, a panther, or a wolf. However, your DM might pick one of these animals for you, or an animal based on a creature appropriate for the campaign setting. The creature looks identical to the beast it takes the form of, but it's creature type is considered to be a fiend (daedra).</p>
      <p>At the end of the 8 hours, your daedric companion appears and gains all the benefits of your Companion’s Bond ability. You can have only one daedric companion at a time.</p>
      <p>If your daedric companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 100 septims worth of rare components, you call forth your companion’s spirit from the depth's of oblivion and use your magic to conjure a new body for it. </p>
      <p>If you use this ability to return a former daedric companion to life while you have a current  companion, your current companion leaves you and is replaced by the restored companion.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>COMPANION’S BOND</p>
      <p>Your animal companion gains a variety of benefits while it is linked to you.</p>
      <p>The animal companion loses its Multiattack action, if it has one.</p>
      <p>The companion obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own.</p>
      <p>When using your Natural Explorer feature, you and your animal companion can both move stealthily at a normal pace.</p>
      <p>Your animal companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, an animal companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls.</p>
      <p>Your animal companion gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws.</p>
      <p>For each level you gain after 3rd, your animal companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly. </p>
      <p>Whenever you gain the Attribute Score Improvement class feature, your companion’s attributes also improve. Your companion can increase one attribute score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two attribute scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can’t increase an attribute score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise. </p>
      <p>Your companion shares your alignment, and has a personality trait and a flaw that you can roll for or select from the tables below. Your companion shares your ideal, and its bond is always, “The ranger who travels with me is a beloved companion for whom I would gladly give my life.”</p>
      <p>Your animal companion gains the benefits of your Favored Enemy feature, and of your Greater Favored Enemy feature when you gain that feature at 6th level. It uses the favored enemies you selected for those features.</p>

                  <p>EXPANDING COMPANION OPTIONS</p>
                  <p>Depending on the nature of your campaign, the DM might choose to expand the options for your animal companion. As a rule of thumb, a beast can serve as an animal companion if it is Medium or smaller, has 15 or fewer hit points, and cannot deal more than 8 damage with a single attack. In general, that applies to creatures with a challenge rating of 1/4 or less, but there are exceptions.</p>

      <p>AMBUSCADE</p>
      <p>At 7th level, Hunters strike first and strike hard. When you roll initiative, you gain a special turn that takes place before other creatures can act. On this turn, you can use your action to take either the Attack or Hide action. If more than one creature in an encounter has this feature, they all act first in order of initiative, then the regular initiative order begins. If you would normally be surprised at the start of an encounter, you are not surprised but you do not gain this extra turn. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>HUNTER'S MASTERY</p>
      <p>Starting at 11th level, you can choose one additional Favored Enemy.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>HIRCINE'S GIFT</p>
      <p>Starting at 15th level, Hircine recognizes your aptitude for the hunt and blesses you with his gift. Once per long rest, you are able to transform into a were-creature of your choice for 1 hour. You normally choose your form from the following lycanthropes: a werebat, a werebear, a wereboar, a werecrocodile, a werelion, a wererat, a wereraven, a wereshark, a weretiger, a werevulture, or a werewolf. However, your DM might pick one of these animals for you, or an animal based on a creature appropriate for the campaign setting. You can find the statistics for these creatures in the Blessings and Curses supplement, or in the Monster Manual.</p>
      <p>You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>
      <p>While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the were-creature, but you retain your alignment, Personality, Intelligence, and Willpower scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious. </p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>You assume the lycanthropes hybrid form and you can’t cast spells or use the were-creature's Shapechanger ability. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell.</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense. </p>

            <p>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</p>

      <p>SCOUT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Scouts rely on stealth and rapid movement to survey routes and opponents, using skirmish tactics when forced to fight. They are skilled in surviving far from the streets of a city, allowing them to scout ahead of their companions during expeditions. By contrast with barbarians, in combat scouts tend to be cautious and methodical, rather than impulsive. Many scouts serve as the eyes and ears of war bands. Ambusher, spy, bounty hunter – these are just a few of the roles that Scouts assume as they range the world.</p>

      <p>ROGUE</p>
      <p>After successfully striking the stone golem in a weak spot, a khajiit calls out to his partner, quickly relaying the pivotal information. Her companion attacks and within seconds, the formidable construct is laid to waste.</p>
      <p>An imperial lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When their target – a notorious slaver – passes the alleyway, the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate, and the assassin’s blade cuts his throat before he can make a sound.</p>
      <p>Shifting her gaze between the bandit's hands and his stance, a dunmer realizes that negotiations have broken down. Darting out of the way from the bandit's sudden movement, she is able to avoid the blow while simultaneously disarming him with a few quick jabs to the kidneys.</p>
      <p>Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and finding their foes weak points to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SKILL AND PRECISION</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks. </p>
      <p>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>A COVERT LIVING</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Every town and city has its share of rogues. Many of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as blackguards, operatives, spies, and assassins,  Often, these scoundrels team up with thieves guilds or noble families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their investigations and interrogations. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where skeevers – and wererats – haunt the sewers.</p>
      <p>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are vagabonds that live for the thrill of uncovering lost secrets, while others take up a life of adventure after being sponsored by noble families. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>CREATING A ROGUE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>As you create your rogue character, consider the character’s relationship to the law. Did you work alongside inspectors and the guard or did you find yourself working as an operative in the thieves guild? Have you changed your stance on your profession, possibly angering local law makers or guild masters? Did you leave to find independent work on your own, in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal? </p>
      <p>What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did you learn undisclosed information than you weren't expected to? Maybe you were able to  break a secret code that led you to a stash of riches to help you start a new life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend another member of your adventuring party – who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>QUICK BUILD</p>
      <p>You can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions. First, Agility should be your highest attribute score, followed by Intelligence. Personality should be your next highest if you plan to emphasize deception and social interaction. Second, choose the charlatan background.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CLASS FEATURES</p>
      <p>As a Rogue, you gain the following class features.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>HIT POINTS</p>
      <p>Hit Dice: 1d8 per rogue level</p>
      <p>Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Endurance modifier</p>
      <p>Hit Points At higher levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Endurance modifier</p>

            <p>Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves' tools.</p>
         </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <p>EXPERTISE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and one of your tool proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiency. </p>
      <p>At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or in tools) to gain this benefit.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PRECISE ATTACKS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Beginning at 1st level, you know how to use your superior agility to outwit and devastate your enemies with tactical precision.</p>
      <p>You gain the ability to make an amount of Precise Attacks. You can make additional Precise Attacks as your level increases, as shown on the Precise Attacks column of the Rogue table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>
      <p>Once per turn, when you make a weapon attack using a ranged or finesse weapon, you can choose to use a Precise Attack to add your Precision Dice, a d4, to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you apply any of the unused Precision Dice roll to your weapon damage roll. </p>
      <p>Your Precision Dice increases as you gain levels, as shown in the Precision Dice column of the Rogue table.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>STRATEGIC AID</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 2nd level, you can use the Help action as a bonus action. Additionally, when you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be within 30 feet of you, rather than 5 feet of you, if the target can see or hear you.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ROGUISH ARCHETYPE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 3rd level you are able to choose one of 3 archetypes that you emulate in the exercise on your rogue abilities: Agent, Assassin, or Inquisitor, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ATTRIBUTE SCORE IMPROVEMENT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>EXTRA ATTACK</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>QUICK THINKING</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 7th level, your quick thinking in the heat of action allows you to also add your Intelligence modifier to your initiative roll.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ADVANCED MANEUVERS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Beginning at 11th level, your nimble mind allows you to better place your attacks for maximum devastation. When you make a weapon attack with a weapon you are proficient with, you can add your Intelligence modifier to your damage roll (minimum 0).</p>
      <p/>
      <p>MENTAL AGILITY</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at the 14th level, you are always aware of your surrounding and are no longer able to be surprised.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>SLIPPERY MIND</p>
      <p>
         <p/>When you reach 15th level, you acquire greater mental strength and gain proficiency on Willpower saving throws.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SOLO ARTIST</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 18th level, when no allies are within 30 feet of you, you gain advantage on all attack rolls.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>STROKE OF LUCK</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.</p>
      <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ROUGISH ARCHETYPE</p>
      <p>Rouges have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice or archetype is a reflection of your focus – not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>AGENT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Agents are operatives and spies that are effectively skilled in deception and disguise, but have trained in the use of deadly force. Self-reliant and independent, agents devote themselves to personal goals, or work for nobles, guild-masters, sovereigns, and anyone else who can afford them. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>MASTER OF DISGUISE</p>
      <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit, and one gaming set of your choice. You also learn two languages of your choice. If you are already proficient with the disguise kit, choose a different tool from those listed in the rogue's proficiencies. </p>
      <p>Additionally, you can unerringly mimic the speech patterns and accent of a creature that you hear speak for at least 1 minute, allowing you to pass yourself off as a native speaker of a particular land, provided that you know the language.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>AMBUSH</p>
      <p>At 3rd level, your Precise Attacks are more effective. When you use a Precise Attack, you roll 1 additional Precision Die of the same dice type.</p>
      <p>When you reach 9th level in this class, you roll 2 additional Precision dice, and you roll 3 additional Precision dice at 15th level.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>INFILTRATION EXPERT</p>
      <p>Starting at 9th level, you can unfailingly create false identities for yourself. You must spend seven days and 100 septims to establish the history, profession, and affiliations for an identity. You can't establish an identity that belongs to someone else. For example, you might acquire appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and official looking certification to establish yourself as a member of a trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants.</p>
      <p>Other characters believe you to be that person until given an obvious reason not to.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>IMPOSTOR</p>
      <p>At 13th level, you gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person's speech, writing and behavior. You must spend at least 3 hours studying these three components of the person's behavior, listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms. </p>
      <p>Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Personality (Deception) check you make to avoid detection.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ETERNAL DECEIT</p>
      <p>Starting at 17th level, your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means, unless you allow it. You can present false thoughts by succeeding on a Personality (Deception) check contested by the mind reader's Willpower (Insight) check.</p>
      <p>Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates you are being truthful, if you so choose, and you can't be compelled to tell the truth by magic.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>MASTER STRATEGIST</p>
      <p>Also at 17th level, you can use a bonus action to direct one of your willing companions to strike. Choose a friendly creature that is within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you. That creature can make a melee or ranged attack with its reaction</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>ASSASSIN</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Trained in the art of death, assassins rely on stealth, poison, and speed to eliminate their foes with deadly efficiency. Diverse in their practice, assassins include ruthless murderers, hired killers, bounty hunters, principled agents of noble causes, and even priests trained to exterminate the enemies of their deity.</p>

      <p>POISON MASTER</p>
      <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn how to make unique poisons designed to coat your weapon of choice.</p>
      <p>You gain proficiency with the poisoner's kit and learn two assassin's poisons of your choice. Your poison options are detailed at the end of the Assassin's description. You learn one additional assassin's poison of your choice at 9th level, and again at 13th, and 17th level. Each time you learn a new assassin's poison, you can also replace one poison you know with a different one.</p>
      <p>Poisons. Once each day, when you spend 1 hour gathering materials and creating poison, you create a series of vials with the various assassin's poisons you know. You can use any combination of these poisons an amount of times equal to your Intelligence modifier. </p>
      <p>On your turn, you can use a bonus action to apply the poison to a weapon, a piece of ammunition, trap components, or other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage. The object remains potent until the poison is delivered through a wound or is washed off. The potency of all unused poisons is lost after 24 hours.</p>
      <p>Saving Throws. Your poisons require your target to make an Endurance saving throw to resist the poisons effects. On a failed save, the target is effected by the poison as noted in its description. On a successful save, the target takes half the amount of damage and suffers no other effects. An affected creature can make another saving throw at the start of each of their turns. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
      <p>Assassin's Poison save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus </p>
      <p>+ your Intelligence modifier</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>NIMBLE ATTACKS</p>
      <p>Starting at 9th level, whenever you roll initiative, roll an additional 1d8 and add the result to the total.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ASSASSINATE</p>
      <p>Starting at 13th level, you are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DEATH STRIKE</p>
      <p>Starting at 17th level, you become a master of instant death. When you attack and hit a creature that is surprised, it must make an Endurance saving throw (DC 8 + your Agility modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your attack against the creature.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ASSASSIN'S POISONS</p>
      <p>If an assassin's poison has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the poison at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in the class.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Basic Poison</p>
      <p>A creature hit by an item with Basic Poison applied to it takes an additional 1d6 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute.</p>
      <p>This poison's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 11th level (2d6), and 17th level (3d6).</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Blinding Poison</p>
      <p>A creature hit by an item with Blinding Poison applied to it takes an additional 1d4 poison damage and is blinded for 1 minute. </p>
      <p>This poison's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 11th level (2d4), and 17th level (3d4).</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Crippling Poison</p>
      <p>Prerequisite: 9th level</p>
      <p>A creature hit by an item with Crippling Poison applied to it takes an additional 1d6 poison damage and has disadvantage on all saving throws for 1 minute.</p>
      <p>This poison's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 11th level (2d6), and 17th level (3d6).</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Defiling Poison</p>
      <p>A creature hit by an item with Defiling Poison applied to it takes an additional 1d6 poison damage and any healing the creature receives is nullified for 1 minute. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>This poison's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 11th level (2d6), and 17th level (3d6).</p>
      <p/>

      <p/>
      <p>EAR FOR DECEIT</p>
      <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you develop a keen ear for picking out lies. Whenever you make a Willpower (Insight) check to determine whether a creature is lying, treat a roll of 7 or lower on the d20 as an 8. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>EYE FOR DETAIL</p>
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to make a Willpower (Perception) check to spot a hidden creature or object or to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to uncover and decipher clues. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>INSIGHTFUL FIGHTING</p>
      <p>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to decipher an opponent’s tactics and develop a counter to them. As  a bonus action, you can make a Willpower (Insight) check against a creature you can see that isn’t incapacitated, contested by the target’s Personality (Deception) check. If you succeed, when you attack a creature and no ally is within 5 feet of you or the target, you can use a precision dice without expending a use.</p>
      <p>This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until you successfully use this feature against a different target.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>STEADY EYE</p>
      <p>At 9th level, you gain advantage on any Willpower (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check if you do move no more than half your speed on the same turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>UNERRING EYE</p>
      <p>At 13th level, your senses are almost impossible to foil.   As an action, you sense the presence of illusions, shapechangers not in their original form, and other magic designed to deceive the senses within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't blinded or deafened. You sense that an effect is attempting to trick you, but gain no insight into what is hidden or its true nature. </p>
      <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>EYE FOR WEAKNESS </p>
      <p>At 17th level, you learn to exploit a creature’s weaknesses by carefully studying its tactics and movement. While your Insightful Fighting feature applies to a creature, you double your Precision Dice roll on attacks against that creature.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>SORCERER</p>
      <p>Golden eyes flashing, an altmer stretches out her hand and unleashes the fire that burns in her veins. As an inferno rages around her foes, her eyes turn black from the daedric influence powering her magic.</p>
      <p>Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, a breton spreads his arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting him momentarily off the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, through him, and out from him in a mighty blast of lightning.</p>
      <p>Crouching behind a stalagmite, an argonian points a finger at a charging falmer. A blast of fire springs from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back behind the rock formation with a grin. </p>
      <p>Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One can’t study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>RAW MAGIC</p>
      <p>
      <p/>Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline, while others have made a dangerous pact with powerful beings to grant them unimaginable power. </p>
      <p>The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some ancestries produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear from the alignment of the stars. Some sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a daedra or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity, exposure to the elemental forces of the Mundus or the maddening chaos of Oblivion.</p>
      <p>Sorcerers don't rely on spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore the way that mages do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>UNEXPLAINED POWERS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it’s unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn’t like to stay quiet. A sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded.</p>
      <p>Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party as mages, making up for a comptive lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous capacity and power in using the spells they know.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CREATING A SORCERER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>The most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the focus of your power. As a starting character, you'll choose a focus that ties to either your ancestry, your birthright, an unexpected event, or to daedric influence, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well? </p>
      <p>How do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its nature? Is it a blessing or a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you’ve been given this power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you the right to do what you want, to take what you want from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful individual in the world – the deity that blessed you at birth or the daedra who chose you to carry this power.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>QUICK BUILD</p>
      <p>You can make a sorcerer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Willpower should be your highest attribute score, followed by Endurance. Second, choose the hermit background. Third, choose the light, prestidigitation, ray of frost, and shocking grasp cantrips, along with the 1st level spells shield and magic missile.</p>

      <p/>
      <p>EQUIPMENT</p>
      <p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any short blade</p>
         </listitem>

         <listitem>
            <p>Two daggers</p>
         </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <p/>
      <p>SPELLCASTING</p>
      <p>
         <p/>You were born with innate magical potential, drawing on a nearly endless font of magicka. This natural gift allows you cast spells. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting, and chapter 11 for the Sorcerer spell list. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>CANTRIPS</p>
      <p>At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>MAGICKA</p>
      <p>The Sorcerer table shows how much magicka you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend magicka, as noted in the spell's description and the Magicka Cost table found in chapter 10.</p>
      <p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and are able to cast 2nd-level spells, you can cast burning hands at either level.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>STUNTED MAGICKA</p>
      <p>Sorcerer's have access to a large pool of magicka, but their natural gift is stunted by reduced regeneration.</p>
      <p>Unlike other spellcasters, sorcerer's do not regain all of their magicka at the end of a long rest. Instead, you only regain half of your expended magicka, rounding up (minimum of 1).</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</p>
      <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.</p>
      <p>The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you can cast, as shown on the table's Spell Level column for your level. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
      <p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you can cast.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SPELLCASTING ATTRIBUTE</p>
      <p>Willpower is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells. You use your Willpower whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Willpower modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
      <p>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +</p>
      <p>your Willpower modifier</p>
      <p>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +</p>
      <p>your Willpower modifier</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>SORCERY FOCUS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 1st level, choose a sorcery focus which describes the field you've devoted yourself to. Choose either the Necromancer, Storm Caller, or Supplicant which are detailed at the end of the class description. </p>
      <p>Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level, and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CAPACITOR </p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 2nd level, you have the ability to absorb magical energy from harmful spells. Sorcerer's are unique to any other magic users in Tamriel. Although they restore magicka at a much slower rate, they have a natural ability to absorb magicka from spells that have been cast at them, essentially becoming a magical battery. </p>
      <p>Whenever you are targeted by a spell that requires you to make a saving throw, you have a chance to absorb magicka, replenishing your magicka. On a successful save you also absorb magicka points equal to the level of the spell cast. You cannot increase your magicka points beyond your maximum magicka point total through this feature. On a failed save, you do not absorb any magicka and are effected by the spell as normal.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>POWER OVERWHELMING</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Beginning at 3rd level, you can push beyond your natural boundaries to cast extraordinary magic. When you cast a spell that you know, you can choose to cast it at a spell level one higher than your current maximum, using magicka as normal (maximum of 9th level). Once you cast a spell in this way, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>
      <p>When you reach 17th level, you can cast 1 additional 6th level spell, and at 19th level, you can cast 1 additional 7th level spell, using magicka as normal, </p>
      <p/>
      <p>ATTRIBUTE SCORE IMPROVEMENT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one attribute score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two attribute scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an attribute score above 20 using this feature.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>EQUILIBRIUM</p>
      <p>
         <p/>When you reach 10th level, you gain further control over your magically infused bloodline, allowing you to transfer your life force into magicka. You can choose to impose one of the following effects:</p>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>As a bonus action, you can expend up to half of your  available hit dice. You restore magicka points equal to half of the total rolled on the hit dice.</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>During a short rest, you can spend magicka points, as though you were casting a spell, to restore an amount of hit dice equal to the spell level cast.</p>
         </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <p>Once you use this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can do so again.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SORCEROUS RESTORATION</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 20th level, you can draw on your reserve of mystical power to regain expended magicka points. You can spend 1 minute meditating to regain half of your expended magicka, rounding up (minimum of 1). Once you regain magicka with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SORCERY FOCUS</p>
      <p>Sorcerer's have devoted themselves to the study of powerful magic. Although their devotion is usually highly debated, sorcerer's typically find themselves with the following dedications: Necromancer, Supplicant, or Storm Caller.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>NECROMANCER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Necromancers are sorcerers who have dedicated themselves to The Black Arts. They utilize the enslavement of involuntary souls and their bodies. </p>
      <p>These dark sorcerers focus on the ability to manipulate the energies that animate all living things. Through an understanding of the thin lines between life, death, and undeath, they sap the life force from creatures, distorting the vital energy, and transforming it into magical power that they can manipulate.</p>
      <p>Necromancy has been banned in some provinces and the practice is widely debated throughout Nirn. Most people see necromancers as menacing, or even villainous, due to the close association with death. Not all necromancers are evil, but the forces they manipulate are considered taboo by many.</p>

      <p>GRIM HARVEST</p>
      <p>At 1st level, you gain the ability to reap life energy from creatures you kill with your spells. Once per turn when you kill one or more creatures with a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain hit points equal to twice the spell's level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the School of Necromancy. You don't gain this benefit for killing constructs or undead.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DARK SOULS</p>
      <p>At 6th level, you add the animate dead spell to list of known spells if you do not already know it. When you cast animate dead, you can target one additional corpse or pile of bones, creating another zombie or skeleton, as appropriate.</p>
      <p>Whenever you create an undead using a necromancy spell, it has additional benefits. </p>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>The creature's hit points maximum is increased by an amount equal to your sorcerer level.</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its weapon damage rolls.</p>
         </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <p/>
      <p>INURED TO UNDEATH</p>
      <p>Beginning at 14th level, you have resistance to necrotic  damage, and your hit point maximum can't be reduced. You have spent so much time dealing with undead and the forces that animate them that you have become inured to some of their worst effects.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>COMMAND UNDEAD</p>
      <p>Also at 14th level, you can use magic to bring undead under your control, even those created by other Necromancers. As an action, you can choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must make a Willpower saving throw against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can't use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.</p>
      <p>Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds or breaks free.</p>
      <p>REAPER</p>
      <p>Starting at 18th level, when you cast a necromancy cantrip or spell of 1st through 5th level that targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>STORM CALLER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Storm Callers take pride in their control over shock spells. They see the Mundas as a great tapestry of woven strands of matter and magicka. Their spells channel and manipulate the magicka through the local warp and weft of the tapestry, agitating its fibers. This generates sparking, which coalesces into magical lighting.</p>
      <p>These sorcerers summon and control weather; hurling lightning-bolts and creating electric fields, and summoning tornadoes and impenetrable fog. They cloak themselves in electric auras and  “ride the lightning” as the hurtle around the battlefield.</p>

      <p>BOUNDLESS STORM</p>
      <p>Starting at 1st level, you can use your bonus action on your turn to cause whirling gusts of elemental air to briefly surround you, immediately before or after you cast a spell of 1st level or higher. Doing so allows you to fly up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>OVERLOAD</p>
      <p>At 6th level, you gain resistance to lightning and thunder damage. In addition, whenever you start casting a spell of 1st level or higher that deals lightning or thunder damage, stormy magic erupts from you. This eruption causes creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you take lightning or thunder  damage (choose each time this ability activates) equal to half your Sorcerer level.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>

      <p/>
      <p>STORM GUIDE</p>
      <p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to subtly control the weather around you. </p>
      <p>If it is raining, you can use an action to cause the rain to stop falling in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on you. You can end this effect as a bonus action.</p>
      <p>If it is windy, you can use a bonus action each round to choose the direction the wind blows in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on you. The wind blows in that direction until the end of your next turn. This feature doesn't alter the speed of the wind.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>STORM'S FURY</p>
      <p>Starting at 14th level, when you are hit by a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal lightning damage to the attacker. The damage equals your sorcerer level. The attacker must also make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker is pushed in a straight line up to 20 feet away from you.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>WIND SOUL</p>
      <p>At 18th level, you gain immunity to lightning and thunder damage.</p>
      <p>You also gain a magical flying speed of 60 feet. As an action, you can reduce your flying speed to 30 for 1 hour and choose a number of creatures within 30 feet of you equal to 3 + your Willpower modifier. The chosen creatures gain a magical flying speed of 30 feet for 1 hour. Once you reduce your flying speed in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SUPPLICANT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Sorcerers that devout themselves to the Daedric Princes are able to gain access to great power not intended for mere mortals. This precarious power comes with a considerable cost that may lead to the supplicants own demise. </p>
      <p>Through a mastery of an arcane discipline known pejoratively as Dark Magic, the sorcerer can alter events in their favor or create immense suffering on others. Though many supplicants are viewed as evil, the use of Dark Magic has many practical uses. Those that can access such power can use it as a necessary safeguard to reign in rogue wizards, and while they can replicate the destructive effects of the daedra, supplicants can also use it to counter similar effects.</p>

      <p/>
      <p>BEND LUCK</p>
      <p>Starting at 6th level, you have the ability to twist fate using magic. When another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction and spend magicka points to add an additional roll to the total, as shown on the Bend Luck table. You can apply the roll as a bonus or a penalty (your choice) to the creature's roll. You can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.</p>
      <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Willpower modifier (minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <p>At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest occupied space. If the target is not a daedra, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.</p>

The supplicant's devotion to the daedra comes with the cost of the inability to control this powerful magic. At 1st level, replace the Daedric Blessing feature with the Wild Magic Surge feature and add the Tides of Chaos feature.

      <p>SPELLSWORD</p>
      <p>Throwing her short sword, a nord aims for the single rope holding up the rickety draw bridge that connects the dark chasm. Her blade strikes true and both the bridge and sword fall. With a smirk and a twitch of her wrist, the sword reappears in her hand.</p>
      <p>Placing his hands together, an imperial concentrates as blue light forms a magical aegis around him and his allies. The lumbering wamasu's lightning breath no longer seems so threatening.</p>
      <p>Holding his long sword up high, a wild-eyed dunmer chants the mystic ritual that engulfs his blade in flame. In a single motion, he carves through the frost atronach standing in his way.</p>
      <p>Spellswords are specialists trained to support troops and skirmish in battle. With a weapon in one hand and a spell in the other, spellswords should never be underestimated.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PRIZED FIGHTERS AND MERCENARIES</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Nimbler and more athletic than a mage, with spell-casting more versatile than a warrior, spellswords are powerful and unpredictable fighters. Many spellswords start their careers as mercenaries or join militias or the Imperial Legion.</p>
      <p>Through vigorous training, spellswords learn how to wield any blade and create a unique bond with their favored weapons. Beyond their martial prowess, spellswords rely on magic to augment their skills and become superior combatants on the battlefield.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DISCIPLINED AND VERSATILE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Not everyone trained in combat and magic can be considered a spellsword. Only those who have mastered how to weave magic into their weapons and dedicate themselves to their craft can truly be considered a spellsword. Likewise, not all spellswords are equal. Some devote themselves to protecting others, some favor magic, while others prefer the blade.</p>
      <p>As adventurers, many spellswords start out as treasure hunters, soldiers of fortune, and mercenaries. Many spellswords take up a life of adventuring to continue their training or search for a greater fortune.</p>

      <p/>
      <p>CREATING A SPELLSWORD</p>
      <p>
         <p/>As you build your spellsword, consider a couple of elements of your character's training: where did you receive your combat training? Were you evenly focused on martial and magical skills, or did you favor one over the other. Did you dedicate your skills on destruction or on the protection of others? Did you get extra help from a mentor? Did your training come from joining the military or were you self taught to protect your homeland</p>
      <p>Where did you learn your magical skill? Was it passed down from a family tradition or did you learn through vigorous study in college? Did you learn magic before you learned how to fight? Or did you pick up magic as a way to set you apart from the other  troops.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>QUICK BUILD</p>
      <p>You can make a spellsword quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Agility your highest attribute score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or finesse weapons). Your next highest score should be Intelligence. Second, choose the soldier background. Third, choose the eldritch blast and green flame blade cantrips, along with the 1st level spells hex and shield.  </p>
      <p/>

   <sect1 id="Section15">
      <p>WEAPON BOND</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 1st level, you can perform a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can been done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.</p>
      <p>Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can't be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.</p>
      <p>You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>IMBUE MAGIC</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Also at 1st level, you learn to invoke powerful magic within your weapon. You choose to learn one Elemental Imbuement listed below.</p>
      <p>As a bonus action, you infuse a single weapon with the magical energy of a known Elemental Imbuement for up to 8 hours. While active, attacks with this weapon deal an additional 1d4 damage of the chosen damage type. This damage is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.</p>
      <p>The damage dealt by your Imbue Magic feature increases as you gain Spellsword levels, as shown in the Imbue Magic column of the Spellsword table. Your enchantment lasts until the spell ends, but it can end early if the weapon is wielded by another creature, or if you fall unconscious.</p>
      <p>If you use this ability to imbue the same weapon again, your current enchantment leaves and is replaced by the new enchantment.</p>
      <p>You learn an additional Elemental Imbuement at 6th level and again at 11th level, and you can choose 1 Arcane Imbuement at 14th level. </p>
      <p>ELEMENTAL IMBUEMENTS</p>
      <p>Choose from the following:</p>
      <p>Flame. You enchant your weapon with the elemental damage of fire.</p>
      <p>Glacier. You enchant your weapon with the elemental damage of cold.</p>
      <p>Storm. You enchant your weapon with the elemental damage of lightning.</p>
      <p>Venom. You enchant your weapon with the elemental damage of poison.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ARCANE IMBUEMENTS</p>
      <p>Choose from the following:</p>
      <p>Decay. You enchant your weapon with the magical damage of necrotic.</p>
      <p>Gloom. You enchant your weapon with the magical damage of psychic.</p>
      <p>Light. You enchant your weapon with the magical damage of radiant.</p>
      <p>Mystic. You enchant your weapon with the magical damage of force.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SPELLCASTING</p>
      <p>
         <p/>By 2nd level, your arcane research grants you the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the spellsword spell list. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>CANTRIPS</p>
      <p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the spellsword spell list. You learn additional spellsword cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Spellsword table.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>MAGICKA</p>
      <p>The Spellsword table shows how much magicka you have to cast your spellsword spells of 1st level and higher.  The table also shows what the level spells you can cast. To cast one of your spellsword spells of 1st level or higher, must expend magicka, as noted in the spell's description and the Magicka Cost table found in chapter 10. You regain all expended magicka when you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell witch bolt and have a Spell Level of 2nd, you can cast witch bolt using magicka to cast it at either level. </p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</p>
      <p>At 2nd level, you know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the spellsword spell list.</p>
      <p>The Spells Known column of the spellsword table shows when you learn more spellsword spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you can cast, as shown on the table's Spell Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new spellsword spell, which can be 1st or 2nd level.</p>
      <p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the spellsword spells you know and replace it with another spell from the spellsword spell list, which also must be of a level for which you can cast.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SPELLCASTING ATTRIBUTE</p>
      <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting attribute for your spellsword spells, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting attribute. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spellsword spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
      <p>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +</p>
      <p>your Intelligence modifier</p>
      <p>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +</p>
      <p>your Intelligence modifier</p>
      <p/>
      <p>MYSTIC PATH</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 3rd level, you choose a mystic path. Choose either Battlemage, Warlock, or Witch Blade, which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your path grants you features at 3rd level, and then again at 6th, 14th, and 20th level.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ATTRIBUTE SCORE IMPROVEMENT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one attribute score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two attribute scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>EXTRA ATTACK</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. </p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>SPELL WEAVING</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>RELIABLE KNOWLEDGE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>When you reach 10th level, you gain a specific talent for understanding the world around you. Whenever you  make an Intelligence ability check, you can treat a d20 roll of a 9 or lower as a 10.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ELDRITCH STRIKE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>By 11th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature's ability to resist your spells. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ARCANE MIGHT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 15th level, you can draw upon the arcane to heighten your physical capabilities. When you make a Strength, Agility, or Endurance ability check, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the roll. </p>
      <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>IMPROVED SPELL WEAVING</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 18th level, when you use your action to cast a spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>MYSTIC PATH</p>
      <p>Spellswords specialize in different forms of protection and offense, which is reflected by their chosen mystic path. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>BATTLEMAGE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Battlemages are wizard-warriors, trained in both lethal spellcasting and heavily armored combat. They sacrifice the ability to supplement their offensive capabilities to better protect themselves and their allies from the devastation of war.</p>
      <p>Commonly found throughout Tamriel's armies, especially in the wide spread Imperial Legion and the Summerset military, battlemages are soldiers trained in warfare, utilizing both magic and more traditional means. Many battlemages find themselves as natural leaders. Using their keen intellect and knack for tactical thought alongside their physical strength, these war-wizards are a force on the battlefield.</p>

      <p/>
      <p>BATTLEMAGE MASTERY</p>
      <p>When you choose this focus at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Heavy Armor</p>
      <p/>
      <p>IMBUE DEFENSE</p>
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use your Imbue Magic feature to invoke powerful magic within your armor instead of your weapon. You learn the Battle Imbuement listed below.</p>
      <p>As a bonus action, you can imbue a set of armor with the energy of a known Arcane Imbuement, Battle Imbuement, or Elemental Imbument for up to 8 hours. While active, you gain resistance to all attacks made against you with this type of damage. Your enchantment ends if you remove your armor or if you fall unconscious.</p>
      <p>If you use this ability to imbue the same armor again, your current enchantment leaves and is replaced by the new enchantment.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>BATTLE IMBUEMENT</p>
      <p>Defense. You gain a +1 bonus to your AC. When you reach 13th level, you gain a +2 bonus to your AC.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>BATTLE WARD</p>
      <p>Also at 3rd level, as a reaction you can create a magical ward on a number of friendly creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you, including yourself. A creature gains a ward from 1d6 to 3d6 hit points (your choice). You have a total pool of 3d6 that you can expend. Subtract the dice given with each use from that total. </p>
      <p>The wards last until the end of your next turn. When a warded creature is targeted with an attack that deals damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If the ward is reduced to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to the creature being attacked. The ward does not benefit from any resistances from you or the warded creature.</p>
      <p>This pool increases to 6d6 at 11th level, 9d6 at 14th level, and 12d6 at 18th level.</p>
      <p>You regain all expended dice from your pool when you finish a long rest. </p>
      <p>BATTLE AURA</p>
      <p>At 6th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to damage from spells.</p>
      <p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>SPELL REFLECT</p>
      <p>Starting at 14th level, while wearing heavy armor, your arcane expertise allows you to redirect harmful spells back at your enemies.</p>
      <p>When you are required to make a Willpower saving throw against a magical spell, you can use your reaction to attempt to reflect the spell back to the caster. On a successful save you reflect the harmful effect back to the caster. On a failed save, you are unable to reflect the spell.</p>
      <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DRAINING AURA</p>
      <p>At 20th level, you can drain the life force of others around you to heal yourself. As an action, you create a 30-foot-radius sphere of draining aura, centered on yourself. Any number of creatures of your choice within the aura must make a Willpower saving throw. On a failed save, the aura drains 1d6 hit points from each creature. A creature can choose to fail the saving throw. You are healed for the total amount of hit points drained.</p>
      <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>WITCH BLADE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Witch Blades create unique bonds with their weapons, allowing themselves to be able to conjure them at will. This allows the witch blade to be armed at the slightest thought, never having to be worried about being caught off guard and making them the perfect assassin.</p>

      <p>MYSTIC BINDING</p>
      <p>When you choose this path at 3rd level, you have discovered an esoteric arcane art that allows you to master an ethereal weapon called the witch blade. As a bonus action you can summon this weapon in your empty hand. You can chose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (Choose any weapon from the long blade or short blade weapon list in Chapter 5). You are proficient with it while you wield it. </p>
      <p>Your witch blade disappears if it is more than 5 feet from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die. </p>
      <p>You can transform one magic weapon into your witch blade by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into a realm of oblivion, and it appears whenever you summon your witch blade thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your witch blade if you die, if you perform the 1 hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1 hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in its realm of oblivion when the bond breaks.</p>
      <p>Additionally, you gain the following benefits.</p>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>You learn the Mystic Arcane Imbuement</p>
         </listitem>

            <p>When the witch blade is formed, it gains the benefits of your Weapon Bond feature.</p>

            <p>If you can throw your witch blade, you can choose to teleport to wherever the blade impacts.</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>Attacks with your witch blade count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.</p>
         </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <p/>
      <p>ETHEREAL STEP</p>
      <p>At 6th level, you learn to step through the Ethereal Plane. As a bonus action on your turn, you can cast the etherealness spell with this feature, but the spell ends at the end of the current turn. </p>
      <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
      <p/>

      <p/>
      <p>DISTANT STRIKE</p>
      <p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to step between the planes in a blink of an eye. When you use the Attack action, you can teleport up to 10 feet before each attack. You must be able to see the destination of the teleportation.</p>
      <p>If you attack at least two different creatures with the action, you can make one additional attack with it against a third creature.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SUPERNATURAL REVISAL</p>
      <p>At 20th level, your witch blade has the ability to turn failure into success. If an attack made with your witch blade misses a target within range, you can turn this miss into a hit.</p>
      <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>WARLOCK</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Experts in arcane secrets, Warlocks have unlocked esoteric knowledge that gives them the upper hand by augmenting common spells to create powerful and unexpected effects. Similar in some ways to mages, warlocks are effective students of the arcane that have learned how to inscribe some spells into a spell book, while committing others to memory.</p>
      <p>Warlocks have also learned how to unravel mystical secrets that heighten or alter common magic. Their  magical expertise combined with their martial prowess make them exceptional adversaries.</p>

      <p>BOOK OF SHADOWS</p>
      <p>When you choose this path at 3rd level, you learn how to weave magic into a grimoire of spells, known as a Book of Shadows. Choose three cantrips from any class's spell list (the three needn't be from the same list). While this book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. If they don't appear on your Spellsword list, they are nonetheless Spellsword spells for you.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>At 6th level, you learn how to inscribe magical rituals into your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list (the two needn't be from the same list). With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can't cast the spells except as rituals, unless you've learned them by some other means. You can also cast a Spellsword spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.</p>
      <p>On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell's level is equal to or less than half your Spellsword level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 200 septims for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.</p>
      <p>If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to create a replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ELDRITCH INVOCATIONS</p>
      <p>Starting at 6th level, your study of occult lore has unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.</p>
      <p>You gain 3 eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed below. You learn 2 additional invocations at 11th level, and again at 17th level.</p>
      <p>Additionally, when you gain a Spellsword level, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>FIENDISH RESILIENCE</p>
      <p>Starting at 14th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ELDRITCH MASTER</p>
      <p>At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power. You can spend 1 minute meditating to regain magicka equal to your 4 times your Intelligence modifier. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>ELDRITCH INVOCATIONS</p>
      <p>If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in the class.</p>

      <p>plane of existence as you, you can use your action</p>
      <p>on subsequent turns to maintain this connection,</p>
      <p>extending the duration until the end of your next turn.</p>
      <p>While perceiving through the other creature’s senses,</p>
      <p>you benefit from any special senses possessed by that</p>

      <p>THIEF</p>
      <p>Signaling for her companions to wait, a khajiit creeps forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into the shadows as her warrior friend moves forward to kick the door open.</p>
      <p>Holding his breath, a bosmer carefully tugs at a hempen rope, releasing a leather coin purse attached to the merchants belt. He then uses his newly found coin to purchase the silver dagger and quickly leaves the store, leaving a generous tip.</p>
      <p>Using his charm and wit, the nord tells the bar maiden a tale from his most recent voyage. Giving a clever smile, the light of the fire glinting off a gold capped tooth, he convinces the waitress to put this round on the house.</p>
      <p>Thieves choose stealth and subterfuge over violence, and often entertain romantic notions of their charm and cleverness in their acquisitive activities. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>SILVER TONGUE AND DAGGER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Thieves rely on many different skills and can usually find a solution to any situation they find themselves in. Preferring to use their charisma to diffuse confrontations, they can also rely on their quick thinking to avoid harm, and are not afraid to engage in hand-to-hand combat. They excel at picking locks and avoiding traps, which makes them a valuable asset to any adventuring party.</p>
      <p>When a thief is forced into combat, they excel in one-on-one battles, or strike and retreat tactics. Thieves have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and choose patience to slowly wear their opponent down, rather than beat them into submission.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>A LIVELIHOOD OF INFAMY</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Thieves are a common in any settlement. Some thieves work on their own, but the most successful join thieves' guilds for the extra opportunities and protection. They can find themselves making a living as simple cutpurses, acting as simple beggars and acrobats, or as dangerous burglars and enforcers. Those that find solace on the seas dedicate their lives to piracy and romantic flings in various port cities, or become deadly marauders, pillaging the less protected villages on the outskirts of society.</p>
      <p>Although not necessarily on the side of the law, many thieves and guilds team up with local law enforcement, creating an unspoken allegiance to regulate crime. Other thieves might prefer to use their particular skills to become locksmiths, or like to think of themselves as professional treasure hunters, explorers, or investigators. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>CREATING A THIEF</p>
      <p>
         <p/>As you create your thief character, consider what you did in the past that allowed you to hone your skills. Do you have a criminal past – or present? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves’ guild master? Or did you leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal? </p>
      <p>What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend another member of your adventuring party – who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>QUICK BUILD</p>
      <p>You can make a thief quickly by following these suggestions. First, Agility should be your highest attribute score, followed by Personality if you plan to emphasize deception and social interaction. Second, choose the urchin background.</p>

      </orderedlist>
      <p>EXCEPTIONAL SPEED</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 1st level, your agile nature increases your speed by 5 feet while unarmored or while wearing light armor. This amount increases as you level. Refer to the Exceptional Speed column of the Thief table.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>LEGERDEMAIN</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 1st level, you have honed your skills in the larcenous arts. You gain advantage when making Sleight of Hand skill checks.</p>

      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>SNEAK ATTACK</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a  finesse or a ranged weapon.</p>
      <p>    You don't need advantage on an attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll. </p>
      <p>    The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels, as shown on the Sneak Attack column of the Thief table.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CUNNING ACTION</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At level 2, your quick thinking and dexterity allow you to move quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action. </p>
      <p>You are also able to use the bonus action to make an Agility (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves' tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>THIEVISH ARCHETYPE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>When you reach level 3 you are able to choose one of 3 thievish archetypes: Acrobat, Burglar, Pirate, or Ruffian, each detailed at the end of the class description. Your archetype grants you features at 3rd level and then again 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ATTRIBUTE SCORE IMPROVEMENT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one attribute score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two attribute scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an attribute score above 20 using this feature.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>UNCANNY DODGE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 5th level, when an attacker you see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the damage against you. </p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>TREASURE HUNTER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 6th level, you have a keen eye for hidden treasures, noticing subtle clues, such as worn surfaces or conspicuous items, that others might miss. Whether it's a cache of relics in an ancient ruin or the prized possession of a humble merchant, you're familiar with where and how things might be hidden. You gain advantage whenever you make a Willpower (Perception) check to search for hidden items or secret doors. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>EVASION</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make an Agility saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>MUFFLED MOVEMENT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 10th level, you have advantage on an Agility (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DISTRACTION</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 11th level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to distract one enemy that is within 30 feet of you that can see and hear you, granting advantage on the next attack made by a creature other than you against that target until the start of the targets next turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CUNNING MANIPULATOR</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 14th level, you can talk your way out of virtually anything. You gain advantage on Personality (Deception) and Personality (Persuasion) skill checks.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>BLINDSENSE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 15th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>ELUSIVE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 18th level, no enemy is able to to gain the upper hand on you. No attack roll has advantage on you while you are conscious. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>THIEVES REFLEXES</p>
      <p>
         <p/>When you reach 20th level, you become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can not use this ability if surprised.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>THIEVISH ARCHETYPE</p>
      <p>Different thieves choose different approaches to their smuggling and deception. A thief might focus their talents on being an expert escapist or treasure hunter, while others hone their skills to become professional explorers or duelists. The thievish archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ACROBAT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Acrobat is a polite euphemism for agile thieves and second-story men. These thieves avoid detection by stealth, and rely on mobility and cunning to avoid capture. They have honed their skills to such a degree that they are almost supernaturally adept at scaling walls, running, jumping, and tumbling. </p>

      <p>TRACING THE PATH</p>
      <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you are able to traverse your environment with ease and efficiency. You gain the following benefits:</p>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>Climbing no longer costs you extra movement.</p>
         </listitem>

            <p>When you make a High Jump or Long jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Agility modifier.</p>

         <listitem>
            <p>You can move along a flat vertical surface as long as you break your movement speed in two short movements. Each movement is half your speed, and you must end each on a creature, solid object, or ground. If not, you fall, taking damage as normal.</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>You can use a bonus action on your turn to gain advantage on the next Agility (Acrobatics) check you make during the same turn. </p>
         </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <p/>
      <p>CAT'S FALL</p>
      <p>Also at 3rd level, your catlike reflexes allows you to cushion your fall. When you fall, you can treat it as though you fell 10 feet fewer, possibly preventing taking any damage.</p>
      <p>You can fall from greater heights without taking damage as you gain levels in this class. You can treat a fall as though you fell 20 feet fewer at 9th level, 30 feet fewer at 13th level, and 40 feet fewer at 17th level. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>DODGE ROLL</p>
      <p>Starting at 9th level, when you use the Uncanny Dodge feature, you can move half your movement speed without provoking opportunity attacks as part of the reaction.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>NIMBLE ESCAPE</p>
      <p>At 13th level, your flexibility and speed prevents you from being held down. You gain advantage on saving throws against being grappled or restrained. </p>
      <p>Additionally, you ignore difficult terrain and moving through another creatures space no longer incurs a penalty to your movement.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>HIGHER GROUND</p>
      <p>At 17th level, you gain advantage when you make a ranged weapon attack against a target that is at least 10 feet below you and when you make a melee weapon attack as part of an acrobatic stunt, such as jumping off a balcony or swinging from a chandelier. </p>

      <p>BURGLAR</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Burglars are well versed in the arts of picking locks. They are able to find their way into areas that others would believe to be inaccessible. They can even sneak into even the most secure of noble houses and escape detection. </p>
      <p>Adventuring burglars are usually sought out by mercenary companies for their resourcefulness in exploring dungeons, palaces, and places where others might be stopped by locked doors or secret passageways. These agile, silent, and curious prowlers  find the challenge of a tricky lock or an open window irresistible and always find a way to slink away with pouches full of treasure.</p>

      <p>TRAP FINDER</p>
      <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you have gained an intuitive sense to understanding the presence and dangers of traps. You gain advantage on Willpower (Perception) checks to find traps and secret doors. You also gain advantage on Agility (Sleight of Hand) checks or when using Thieves' Tools to disable a trap.</p>
      <p>Additionally, you become vigilant to the effects of traps. You gain advantage whenever a trap forces you to make an Agility saving throw. You also gain a +1 bonus to AC when a trap makes an attack roll against you. This bonus increases to +2 when you reach 9th level, +3 at 13th level, and +4 at 17th level.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>LIGHTFOOT</p>
      <p>Beginning at 9th level, you instinctively move softly and quietly. You gain a passive Agility (Stealth) score equal to 10 plus your Agility (Stealth) modifier and can no longer trigger alarms or traps that rely on weight, such as pressure plates or trip lines.  </p>
      <p/>
      <p>DELAY TRAP</p>
      <p>Starting at 13th level, if you are within 10 feet of a trap that has been triggered you can use your reaction to make a Thieves' Tools check against the trap's DC to attempt to delay the trap. On a successful check, you delay the trap until the end of your next turn. If you critically succeed the check, you successfully disable the trap, preventing it from activating.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>MISLEAD</p>
      <p>Also at 13th level, when a creature you are aware of fails a Willpower (Perception) check to detect you, you can use a bonus action to use sounds, mirrors, decoys or other clever tactics to mislead them. A creature that has been misled might move their investigation to another area or abandon their search altogether. A misled creature has disadvantage on additional Willpower (Perception) checks to find you again while you remain hidden.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>MISDIRECTION</p>
      <p>At 17th level, when a melee attack that targets you misses, you can use your reaction to force the attack to strike another creature within range of the attack. The creature rerolls the attack against the new target.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PIRATE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>You focus your training on the art of the the art of the blade, relying on speed, elegance, and charm in equal parts. While some fighter are brutes clad in heavy armor, your method of fighting looks almost like a performance. Duelists and swashbucklers typically belong to this archetype.</p>
      <p>A pirate excels in single combat, and can fight with two weapon while safely darting away from an opponent.</p>

      <p>FANCY FOOTWORK</p>
      <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn how to land a strike and then slip away without reprisal. During your turn, iff you make a melee attack against a creature, that creature can't make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>RAKISH AUDACITY</p>
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, your confidence propels you into battle. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Personality modifier.</p>
      <p>You also gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack; you don't need advantage against a creature if you are within 5 feet of it, no other creatures are within 5 feet of you, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll. All other rules for Sneak Attack still apply to you.</p>
      <p>PANACHE</p>
      <p>At 9th level, your charm becomes extraordinarily beguiling. As an action, you can make a Personality (Persuasion) check contested by a creature's Willpower (Insight) check. The creature must be able to hear you, and the two of you must share a language.</p>
      <p>If you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile to you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you and can't make opportunity attacks against targets other than you. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until one of your companions attacks the target or affects it with a spell, or until you and the target are more than 60 feet apart.</p>
      <p>If you succeed on the check and the creature isn't hostile to you, it is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance. This effect ends immediately if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ELEGANT MANEUVER</p>
      <p>Starting at 13th level, you can use a bonus action on your turn to gain advantage on the next Agility (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check you make during the same turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>MASTER DUELIST</p>
      <p>Beginning at 17th level, your mastery of the blade lets you turn failure into success in combat. If you miss with an attack roll, you can roll it again with advantage, Once you do so, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>RUFFIAN</p>
      <p>
         <p/>While most thieves spend their time practicing being unheard and unseen, ruffians take a different approach. Relying on brute strength and browbeating, rather than finesse and speed, these brash thieves pummel and intimidate their foes into submission. </p>

      <p/>
      <p>BADGER </p>
      <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the Intimidation skill if you don't already have proficiency with it. You also gain advantage on all attempts to bribe someone.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>BLUDGEONER</p>
      <p>Also at 3rd level, you can now use your Sneak Attack feature with unarmed strikes or with blunt weapons  that do not have the heavy, two-handed, or versatile trait. You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike.</p>
      <p>Debilitating Strike. Your critical hits with blunt weapons are particularly devastating. When you score a critical hit against a creature when using a blunt weapon or with an unarmed strike, you can apply a debilitating strike to the target. You know the Hamstring debilitating strike at 3rd level and learn one additional debilitating strike at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>
      <p>Saving Throws. Some of your debilitating strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the strikes effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
      <p>Debilitating Strike DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +</p>
      <p>your Agility modifier</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SILENT WARMONGER</p>
      <p>At 9th level, your chance to score a critical hit with any attack that meets the conditions of a Sneak Attack increases. You can now critically hit with a roll of 19 or 20.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DOMINATING GESTURE</p>
      <p>At 13th level, after you kill a foe, or knock one unconscious, you can use a reaction to make a Personality (Intimidation) check with advantage against another enemy that can see and hear you. On a failed save, the creature has disadvantage on attacks until the end of your next turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SUCKER PUNCH</p>
      <p>Beginning at 17th level, when you use the Attack action to make a weapon attack on your turn, you can make an unarmed strike as part of that action.</p>
      <p/>

      <p>DEBILITATING STRIKES</p>
      <p>The debilitating strikes are presented in alphabetical order. If a debilitating strike has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the strike at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in the class.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Blackjack</p>
      <p>Prerequisite: 17th level, Stunning Strike</p>
      <p>The target is knocked unconscious. The creature can make an Endurance saving throw at the end of each of it's turns to end the effect.</p>
      <p>Dazing Strike</p>
      <p>The target has disadvantage on concentration saving throws for the next minute. The creature can make an Endurance saving throw at the end of each of it's turns to end the effect.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Enfeebling Strike</p>
      <p>The target has disadvantage on attacks for the next minute. The creature can make an Endurance saving throw at the end of each of it's turns to end the effect.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Hamstring</p>
      <p>The target becomes hamstrung and can only move 5 feet for the next minute. The hamstrung creature can make an Agility saving throw at the end of each of it's turns to end the effect.</p>

      <p>The target is plyzed for the next minute. The creature can make an Endurance saving throw at the end of each of it's turns to end the effect.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Reeling Blow</p>
      <p>The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is pushed away 10 feet. On a failed save, the creature is also knocked prone.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Stunning Strike</p>
      <p>Prerequisite: 13th level</p>
      <p>The target is stunned for the next minute. The creature can make an Endurance saving throw at the end of each of it's turns to end the effect.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Unbalancing Blow</p>
      <p>The next attack made against the target before the end of your next turn has advantage.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Vulnerable Strike</p>
      <p>Prerequisite: 13th level, Unbalancing Blow</p>
      <p>The target is vulnerable to next attack that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage to it.</p>

      <p>WARRIOR</p>
      <p>Warriors are the professional men-at-arms, soldiers, mercenaries, and adventurers of the Empire, trained with various weapons and armor styles, conditioned by long marches, and hardened by ambush, skirmish, and battle. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>An Imperial in clanging plate armor holds her shield before her as she runs toward the massed goblins. A bosmer behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The orc nearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.</p>
      <p>A nord in chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre’s club and his companion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a dunmer in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses. </p>
      <p>A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd’s delight – and his own tactical advantage. His opponent’s sword flares with red light an instant before she sends flames flashing forth to smite him. </p>
      <p>All of these heroes are warriors, perhaps the most diverse class of characters in the world of Tamriel. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings – as warriors, they all share an unplleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>WELL-ROUNDED SPECIALISTS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Warriors learn the basics of all combat styles. Every warrior can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a warrior is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each warrior specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes warriors superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike. </p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>TRAINED FOR DANGER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, or the queen’s army is a warrior. Most of these troops are relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic combat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar figures are warriors. </p>
      <p>Some warriors feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a warrior, not all that different from the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewards – few warriors in the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue sword, for example.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CREATING A WARRIOR</p>
      <p>
         <p/>As you build your warrior, think about two related elements of your character's background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors. </p>
      <p>You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble’s army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught – unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions—the only things that stand between you and death’s embrace. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>QUICK BUILD</p>
      <p>You can make a warrior quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Agility your highest attribute score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or finesse weapons). Your next highest score should be Endurance. Second, choose the soldier background.</p>

         </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <p>WARRIOR STYLE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>As a warrior, you have trained in either offensive and defensive fighting styles, realizing that not all battles are won with the blade alone. You learn either one defensive style or one fighting style. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>DEFENSIVE STYLE</p>
      <p>You adopt a particular style of defense as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Defensive Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Defense</p>
      <p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Protection</p>
      <p>When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Stalwart</p>
      <p>When you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this feature, you can't use this again until you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Titan </p>
      <p>While you are wearing armor, you are immune to being frightened or stunned. Also, when you gain a level of exhaustion, you suffer the effects of the previous level of exhaustion. For example, at exhaustion level 1, you suffer no effects, but at exhaustion level 3, you would suffer from the effects of exhaustion level 2. If you gain 7 levels of exhaustion, you die.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>FIGHTING STYLE</p>
      <p>You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Archery</p>
      <p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Dueling</p>
      <p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain +2 to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Great Weapon Fighting</p>
      <p>When you roll a 1 or a 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if it is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Two-Weapon Fighting</p>
      <p>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SECOND WIND</p>
      <p>
         <p/>You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your warrior level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ACTION SURGE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.</p>
      <p>Once you use this feature you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>WARRIOR ARCHETYPE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques. Choose either Assault, Defense, or Dragon Knight, each detailed at the end of the class description. Additionally, you can choose any Fighter's Martial Archetype outlined in the Player's Handbook. The archetype you choose also grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ATTRIBUTE SCORE IMPROVEMENT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one attribute score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two attribute scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an attribute score above 20 using this feature.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>EXTRA ATTACK</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level, and to four when you reach 20th level.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>INDOMITABLE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p>You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between longs rests beginning at 17th level.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ARCHETYPES</p>
      <p>Different warriors choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ASSAULT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>The Assault archetype focuses on a nearly academic approach to combat. The warrior absorbs lessons of history, theory, and artistry that combines to create a well rounded fighter of great skill and knowledge.</p>

      <p>WAR TACTICS</p>
      <p>When you chose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn tactics that are fueled by special dice called Tactical Dice. </p>
      <p>Tactics. You learn three tactics of your choice, which are detailed under “War Tactics” below. Many tactics enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one tactic per attack.</p>
      <p>You learn two additional tactics of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new tactics, you can also replace one tactic you know with a different one.</p>
      <p>Tactical Dice. You have four tactical dice, which are d8s. A tactical die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended tactical dice when you finish a short or long rest. </p>
      <p>You gain another tactical die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.</p>
      <p>Saving Throws. Some of your tactics require your target to make a saving throw to resist the tactic’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
      <p>Tactic save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + </p>
      <p>your Strength or Agility modifier (your choice)</p>
      <p/>
      <p>COMBAT SENSE</p>
      <p>Starting at 7th level, your keen sense allows you to react faster during combat. You add your tactical dice to your initiative roll, and all enemies have disadvantage against attacking you on the first round of combat.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ADDITIONAL FIGHTING STYLE</p>
      <p>At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the  Fighting Style class feature.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>IMPROVED CRITICAL</p>
      <p>Beginning at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>WARRIOR'S HEART</p>
      <p>At 18th level, you learn how to exploit weakened targets. You can choose to heighten your combat focus, allowing you to deal more damage inverse proportionately to the enemies health. </p>

      <p>You maintain your focus as long as you are in combat. You must complete a long rest before being able to use this feature again.</p>
      <p>WAR TACTICS</p>
      <p>The tactics are presented in alphabetical order. </p>
      <p>Cleave. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one tactical die to cleave your weapon, striking each creature in a 90 degree cone. If the original attack roll would hit any additional creatures, they take damage equal to the number you roll on your tactical die, divided equally between the additional creatures hit. The main target only takes the damage from your original attack.</p>
      <p>Commander's Strike. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one tactical die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding a tactical die to the attack's damage roll.</p>
      <p>Feinting Attack. You can expend one tactical die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature this turn. If that attack hits, add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll.</p>
      <p>Lunging Attack. When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one tactical die to increase your reach for the attack by 5 feet. If you hit, you add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll.</p>
      <p>Menacing Attack. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to frighten the target. You add your tactical die to the attacks damage roll, and the target must make a Personality saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened until it's next turn.</p>
      <p>Pierce Armor. When you hit a creature that is wearing armor with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to weaken their armor, reducing the targets AC by 1. If you hit, you add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll. You can not weaken the same armor more than once.</p>
      <p>Precision Attack. When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one tactical die to add it to the roll. You can use this tactic before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.</p>
      <p>Riposte. When an enemy misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one tactical die to make a melee weapon attack against the same enemy. If you hit, add a tactical die to the attack's damage roll.</p>
      <p>Sweeping Attack. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to damage another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your tactical die. The damage is of the same type dealt for the original attack.</p>
      <p>Uppercut. When you hit a creature with weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to slam the target with an upward blow, knocking the target down. You add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it is knocked back 5 feet and falls prone. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>DEFENSE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Those who emulate this archetype employ defensive techniques passed down through the generations. Through rigorous training, your armor and shield become a like a second skin that you can use to protect yourself and your allies.</p>

      <p>DEFENSIVE TACTICS</p>
      <p>When you chose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn tactics that are fueled by special dice called Tactical Dice. </p>
      <p>Tactics. You learn three tactics of your choice, which are detailed under “Defensive Tactics” below. Many tactics enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one tactic per attack.</p>
      <p>You learn two additional tactics of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new tactics, you can also replace one tactic you know with a different one.</p>
      <p>Tactical Dice. You have four tactical dice, which are d8s. A tactical die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended tactical dice when you finish a short or long rest. </p>
      <p>You gain another tactical die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.</p>
      <p>Saving Throws. Some of your tactics require your target to make a saving throw to resist the tactic’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
      <p>Tactic save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + </p>
      <p>your Strength or Agility modifier (your choice)</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DEFENDER'S SACRIFICE</p>
      <p>Starting at 7th level, when a creature you can see damages a target other than you that is withing 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to take the blow instead. This damage to you can't be reduced or prevented in any way.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ADDITIONAL DEFENSIVE STYLE</p>
      <p>At 10th level, you choose an additional option from the  Defensive Style class feature.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>BULWARK</p>
      <p>Beginning at 15th level, you can extend the benefit of your Indomitable feature to an ally. When use your Indomitable feature to reroll a saving throw and you aren't incapacitated, you can choose one ally within 60 feet of you that also failed its saving throw against the same effect. If that creature can see or hear you, it can reroll its saving throw and must use the new roll.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SURVIVOR</p>
      <p>At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Endurance modifier if you have no more than half your hit points left. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DEFENSIVE TACTICS</p>
      <p>The tactics are presented in alphabetical order. </p>
      <p>Disarming Attack. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.</p>
      <p>Evasive footwork. When you move, you can expend one tactical die, rolling a tactical die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.</p>
      <p>Goading Attack. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Willpower saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>Maneuvering Attack. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to maneuver one of your allies into a more advantageous position. You add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use it's reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.</p>
      <p>Parry. When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one tactical die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your tactical die + your Agility modifier.</p>
      <p>Power Bash. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to throw the attacker off balance. You add the tactical die roll to the attack's damage roll, and it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it is staggered and has disadvantage on their next attack.</p>
      <p>Pushing Attack. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the tactical die roll to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.</p>
      <p>Rally. On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one tactical die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to the tactical die roll + your Personality modifier.</p>
      <p>Shield Wall. When another creature attacks you, you can use your reaction and expend one tactical die to increase your AC by the number you roll on your tactical die, until the start of your next turn.</p>
      <p>Trip Attack. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the tactical die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DRAGON KNIGHT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>These skillful masters-at-arms use the ancient Akaviri martial tradition of battle-spirit, which bears all of the hallmarks of a coherent magical discipline. Their abilities are said to be descended from the powers of legendary dragons and the mortals who fought them. They wield fearsome magic that pounds, shatters and physically alters the world around them.  </p>

      <p>DRACONIC TACTICS</p>
      <p>When you chose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn tactics that are fueled by special dice called Tactical Dice. </p>
      <p>Tactics. You learn three tactics of your choice, which are detailed under “Draconic Tactics” below. Many tactics enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one tactic per attack.</p>
      <p>You learn two additional tactics of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new tactics, you can also replace one tactic you know with a different one.</p>

      <p>your Strength or Agility modifier (your choice)</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SPIKED ARMOR</p>
      <p>At 7th level, you gain the ability to summon draconic spikes from your armor, which you can use as a weapon.</p>
      <p>While wearing armor, as a bonus action, you summon draconic spikes, which sprout from your armor, and last until you use a bonus action to dismiss them. While your spikes are active, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack with your armor spikes against a target within 5 feet of you. If the attack hits, the spikes deal 1d4 piercing damage. You use your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls. </p>
      <p>Additionally, when you use the Attack action to grapple a creature, the target takes 3 piercing damage if your grapples succeeds.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>DRACONIC HASTE</p>
      <p>Beginning at 10th level, when you use your action to make a Draconic Tactic, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DRAGON BLOOD</p>
      <p>At 15th level, when you use your Second Wind feature, your draconic blood radiates with ancient healing energy, allowing your allies to fight past their injuries. Three creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you that are allied with you regain hit points equal to half your Warrior level.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>IMPROVED DRACONIC HASTE</p>
      <p>Starting at 18th level, when you use your action to make a Draconic Tactic, you can make two weapon attacks as a bonus action.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DRACONIC TACTICS</p>
      <p>The tactics are presented in alphabetical order. </p>
      <p>Ash Cloud. On your turn, you can use your action and expend one tactical die to create a 20 foot radius sphere of ash and dust centered on a point within 60 feet of you. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lasts for up to 1 minute, as though you cast a spell using concentration. </p>
      <p>Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make an Endurance saving throw. On a failed save, the creature spends its action choking on the soot and ash. Creatures that don't require to breath automatically succeed on this saving throw.</p>
      <p>Combustion. When you take damage from a melee attack, you can use a reaction and expend one tactical die to create a burst of flame causing every creature within 5 feet of you to take a pulse of fire damage equal to your tactical die.</p>
      <p>Dark Talons. On your turn, you can use your action and expend one tactical die to call forth draconic talons from the ground underneath a creature that you can see within 60 feet. The creature takes 1d6 piercing damage and additional piercing damage determined by your tactical die, and must make a Strength saving throw, or be grappled by the talons. </p>
      <p>Fire Breath. On your turn, you can use your action and expend one tactical die to exhale a breath of fire. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must make an Agility saving throw. A creature takes 1d6 fire damage and additional fire damage equal to your tactical die on a failed save, and half as much on a successful one. </p>
      <p>Inferno. On your turn, you can use your action and expend one tactical die to create flames that race across your body, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet for the next minute, as though you cast a spell using concentration. The flames don’t harm you.  </p>
      <p>While the aura is active, you are resistant to fire damage, and any creature that moves within 5 feet of you for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there takes fire damage determined by your tactical die. </p>
      <p>Lava Whip. On your turn, you can use your action and expend one tactical die to create a long whip of flames that lashes out at your command toward a creature within 30 feet. Make a melee attack against the target. If the attack hits, the creature takes 1d6 fire damage and additional fire damage determined by your tactical die, and if the creature is Large or smaller, you pull the creature up to 10 feet towards you.</p>
      <p>Magma Armor. When another creature attacks you, you can use a reaction and expend one tactical die to harden the molten lava in your veins. You become resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage until the beginning of your next turn.</p>
      <p>Petrify. On your turn, you can use your action and expend one tactical die to attempt to envelop a creature that you can see within 60 feet completely in stone. The target must make a Willpower saving throw or become immobilized and unable to speak, hear, move, or make any actions. The restrained creature takes necrotic damage determined by your tactical die and must make a Strength saving throw at the start of each of their turns to try and break free. </p>
      <p>If it successfully saves three times, the condition ends. If it fails saves three times, the stone permanently hardens and the creature is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.</p>
      <p>While encased, the stone shell has an AC of 5 and has 60 hit points. When the stone reaches 0 hit points the stone breaks, ending the effect.</p>
      <p>Reflective Scales. When targeted by a ranged attack, you can use a reaction and expend one tactical die to harden your skin to become similar to a dragons scales. You reduce the damage by the number you roll on your tactical die + your Endurance modifier.</p>
      <p>Searing Strike. When you make a melee weapon attack, you can expend one tactical die to envelop your weapon in bright white flame, dealing additional fire damage, determined by your tactical die.</p>

   <p>CHAPTER 4: PERSONALITY AND BACKGROUND</p>
   <sect1 id="Section12">
      <p>Characters are defined by much more than their</p>
      <p>race and class. They’re individuals with their own stories, interests, connections, and capabilities beyond those that class and race define. This chapter expounds on the details that distinguish characters from one another, including the basics of name and physical description, the rules of backgrounds and languages, and the finer points of personality and alignment. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>CHARACTER DETAILS</p>
      <p>Your character’s name and physical description might be the first things that the other players at the table learn about you. It’s worth thinking about how these characteristics reflect the character you have in mind. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>NAME</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Your character’s race description includes sample names for members of that race. Put some thought into your name even if you’re just picking one from a list. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>SEX</p>
      <p>
         <p/>You can play a male or female character without gaining any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how your character does or does not conform to the broader culture’s expectations of sex, gender, and sexual behavior. For example, a male orc healer defies the traditional gender divisions of orc society, which could be a reason for your character to leave the clan and travel to a city. </p>
      <p>You don’t need to be confined to binary notions of sex and gender. The daedric lords are often seen as androgynous, for example. You could also play a female character who presents herself as a man, a man who feels trapped in a female body, or a beautiful male elf who hates being mistaken for as a woman. Likewise, your character’s sexual orientation is for you to decide.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>HEIGHT AND WEIGHT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>You can decide your character’s height and weight, using the information provided in your race description or on the Random Height and Weight table. Think about what your character’s ability scores might say about his or her height and weight. A weak but agile character might be thin. A strong and tough character might be tall or just heavy. </p>
      <p>If you want to, you can roll randomly for your character’s height and weight using the Random Height and Weight table. The dice roll given in the Height Modifier column determines the character’s extra height (in inches) beyond the base height. That same number multiplied by the dice roll or quantity given in the Weight Modifier column determines the character’s extra weight (in pounds) beyond the base weight. </p>

      <p>For example, as a nord, Svana has a height of 4 feet 10 inches plus 2d10 inches. Her player rolls 2d10 and gets a total of 12, so Svana stands 5 feet 10 inches tall. Then the player uses that same roll of 12 and multiplies it by 2d4 pounds. Her 2d4 roll is 3, so Svana weighs an extra 36 pounds (12 × 3) on top of her base 110 pounds, for a total of 146 pounds.</p>

      <p>OTHER PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>You choose your character’s age and the color of his or her hair, eyes, and skin. To add a touch of distinctiveness, you might want to give your character an unusual or memorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp, or a tattoo.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>ALIGNMENT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>A typical creature in the world Tamriel has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes, although these are usually complex and ambiguous. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or  neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations. </p>
      <p>These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment. </p>
      <p>Lawful good (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. </p>
      <p>Neutral good (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. </p>
      <p>Chaotic good (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. </p>
      <p>Lawful neutral (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. </p>
      <p>Neutral (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what seems best at the time. </p>
      <p>Chaotic neutral (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. </p>
      <p>Lawful evil (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. </p>
      <p>Neutral evil (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. </p>
      <p>Chaotic evil (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>ALIGNMENT IN TAMRIEL</p>
      <p>For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Mer, Mer, Betmer, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-aligned aedra who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery. </p>
      <p>The evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. </p>
      <p>Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments—they are unaligned. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment. </p>

                  <p>The details in this chapter make a big difference in setting your character apart from every other character. Consider the following two Nord warriors.</p>
                  <p>Hailing from Skyrim, Svana was a brash teenager who had a rough childhood. The daughter of a thief, she ran away from home and practiced her father’s trade on the streets of Helgen. When she tried to rob the proprietor of the Helgen Homestead Inn, he caught her and took her under his wing, giving her a job as a barmaid. But when the dragon Alduin laid waste to the town of Helgen and destroyed the inn, necessity forced Svana into adventure alongside the friends she’d known from her childhood. Her skill as a warrior (a frying pan remains one of her favorite weapons) combined with her history on the streets gave her skills invaluable in her adventuring career.</p>
                  <p>Jorg grew up on the streets of Riften. He used his wits, strength, and agility to carve out his own territory in one of the city’s hundreds of poor shanty towns. After several years, he attracted the notice of one of the most powerful thieves’ guilds in the city, and he ascended the ranks of the guild quickly despite his youth. Jorg became the favored assassin of one of the city’s Shadowfoots, who sent him to far-off Solitude to recover some stolen gems. He’s a professional killer, constantly challenging himself to improve his skills.</p>
                  <p>Svana and Jorg are both Nords and both warriors (with some experience as rogues), possessing similarly high Strength and Agility scores, but there the similarity ends.</p>

      <p>LANGUAGES</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Your race indicates the languages your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet. </p>
      <p>    Choose your languages from the Standard Languages table, or choose one that is common in your campaign. With your DM’s permission, you can instead choose a language from the Rare Languages table or a secret language, such as thieves’ cant. </p>

      <p>PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Fleshing out your character’s personality—the array of traits, mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give a person a unique identity—will help you bring him or her to life as you play the game. Four categories of characteristics are presented here: personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about your character’s favorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you can imagine. </p>
      <p>Each background presented later in this chapter includes suggested characteristics that you can use to spark your imagination. You’re not bound to those options, but they’re a good starting point. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>PERSONALITY TRAITS</p>
      <p>Give your character two personality traits. Personality traits are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart from every other character. Your personality traits should tell you something interesting and fun about your character. They should be self descriptions that are specific about what makes your character stand out. “I’m smart” is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. “I’ve read every book in the Imperial Palace” tells you something specific about your character’s interests and disposition. </p>
      <p>Personality traits might describe the things your character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your character dislikes or fears, your character’s self-attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability scores. </p>
      <p>A useful place to start thinking about personality traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and define one trait related to each. Either one could be positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a low score, for example, or be cocky about your high score. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>IDEALS</p>
      <p>Describe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals are the things that you believe in most strongly, the fundamental moral and ethical principles that compel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life goals to your core belief system. </p>
      <p>Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that you will never betray? What would prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to act and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single most important thing you strive for? </p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>You can choose any ideals you like, but your character’s alignment is a good place to start defining them. Each background in this chapter includes six suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: law, chaos, good, evil, and neutrality. The last one has more to do with the particular background than with moral or ethical perspectives. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>BONDS</p>
      <p>Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a character’s connections to people, places, and events in the world. They tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you to act against your own best interests if they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a character’s motivations and goals.</p>
      <p>Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do you care most about? To what place do you feel a special connection? What is your most treasured possession? </p>
      <p>Your bonds might be tied to your class, your background, your race, or some other aspect of your character’s history or personality. You might also gain new bonds over the course of your adventures.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>FLAWS </p>
      <p>Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character’s flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness—in particular, anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against your best interests. More significant than negative personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these questions: What enrages you? What’s the one person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What are your vices?</p>

      <p>LUCK</p>
      <p>Luck is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that’s true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By using luck, you can draw on your personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or luck can let you call on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the effect of a spell that has been laid on you. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>GAINING LUCK</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Your DM can choose to give you luck for a variety of reasons. Typically, DMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a compelling way. Your DM will tell you how you can earn luck in the game. You either have luck or you don’t—you can’t stockpile multiple “lucks” for later use.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>USING LUCK</p>
      <p>
         <p/>If you have luck, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your luck gives you advantage on that roll. Additionally, if you have luck, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your luck to give that character luck.</p>

      <p>CONSTELLATIONS</p>
      <p>There are thirteen named constellations in the sky. There are three Guardian signs; The Warrior, The Mage, and The Thief, each of which protects three charges. Each of these twelve signs corresponds to one of the twelve months in the Tamrielic year. The thirteenth sign, The Serpent, has no guardian or month and moves around the sky, usually threatening the other signs. </p>
      <p>You can decide your character's birthsign, using your class and intended playstyle to determine what sign best suits your character. </p>
      <p>If you want to randomly choose what birthsign you were born under, you can use the table to the side to determine the month of your birth. Roll a d12 to determine what month you were born in, and then a second d12. If your second roll matches your first roll, the Serpent intervenes and becomes your birthsign. For example, if you roll a 6 on your first die, indicating you were born in Mid Year. On your second roll, if you roll another 6, your birthsign is The Serpent. If you roll any other number,  your birthsign is The Steed.</p>

      <p>Stunted Magicka. The Atronach birthsign has gifted you with a large pool of magicka, but your natural gift is stunted by reduced regeneration.</p>
      <p>Unlike other spellcasters, you do not regain all of your magicka at the end of a long rest, instead, you only regain half of your expended magicka, rounding up (minimum of 1). </p>
      <p>Additionally, whenever you are targeted by a spell that requires you to make a saving throw, you have a chance to absorb magicka, replenishing your magicka points. On a successful save you also absorb magicka equal to the level of the spell. On a failed save, you do not absorb any magicka and are effected by the spell as normal.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>You cannot increase your magicka points beyond your maximum magicka point total through this feature.</p>

                  <p>Sorcerer's who are born under the Atronach birthsign innately have access to an extraordinary amount of magicka that truly sets them apart from others on Tamriel. These exceptional gifts, however, come with an exceptional cost. </p>
                  <p>The natural magicka regeneration by a sorcerer born under any other sign is already significantly reduced from other spellcasters. Those born under the Atronach see that regeneration reduced even further. </p>
                  <p>Like other sorcerer's, they do not regain all of their magicka at the end of a long rest. Instead, you only regain a quarter of your expended magicka, rounding up (minimum of 1).</p>
                  <p>Whenever the sorcerer is targeted by a spell that requires a saving throw, the sorcerer absorbs magicka equal to the cost of the spell.</p>

      <p>THE THIEF</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Evening Star</p>
      <p>You were born under the Birthsign of the Thief and gain the following benefits:</p>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>Your Agility score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.</p>

            <p>Your speed  increases by 5 feet.</p>

            <p>You gain one Luck Point. Your Luck Point is a d6. You can add your Luck Point to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw you make. You can wait until after you roll the d20 before deciding to use the Luck Point, but must decided before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. You regain your expended Luck Point at the next dawn, and you can never have more that one Luck Point from this feature at a time. </p>

      <p>BACKGROUNDS</p>
      <p>Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your warrior might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your mage could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.</p>
      <p>Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character’s identity. The most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don't you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?</p>
      <p>The sample backgrounds in this section provide both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PROFICIENCIES</p>
      <p>Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills. Skills are described in chapter 7. </p>
      <p>In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools. Tools and tool proficiencies are detailed in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook.</p>
      <p>If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>LANGUAGES</p>
      <p>Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race. See “Languages” earlier in this chapter.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>EQUIPMENT</p>
      <p>Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional rule from chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</p>
      <p>A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>CUSTOMIZING A BACKGROUND</p>
      <p>You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook. (If you spend coin, you can’t also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your DM to create one.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ACOLYTE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Refer to the Player's Handbook page 127 for more information.</p>
      <p>You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the gods and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine.</p>
      <p>Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being from the world of the Elder Scrolls or those specified by your DM, and work with your DM to detail the nature of your religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion</p>
      <p>Languages: Two of your choice</p>
      <p>Equipment: A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 60 septims. </p>
      <p/>

      <p/>
      <p>FEATURE: SHELTER OF THE FAITHFUL</p>
      <p>As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells, if any. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.</p>
      <p>You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</p>
      <p>Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities.Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme. </p>

      <p>CHARLATAN</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Refer to the Player's Handbook page 128 for more information.</p>
      <p>You have always had a way with people. You know what makes them tick, you can tease out their hearts' desires after a few minutes of conversation, and with a few leading questions you can read them like they were children's books. It’s a useful talent, and one that you’re perfectly willing to use for your advantage.    You know what people want and you deliver, or rather, you promise to deliver. Common sense should steer people away from things that sound too good to be true, but common sense seems to be in short supply when you’re around. The bottle of pink-colored liquid will surely cure that unseemly rash, this ointment—nothing more than a bit of fat with a sprinkle of silver dust—can restore youth and vigor, and there’s a bridge in the city that just happens to be for sale. These marvels sound implausible, but you make them sound like the real deal. </p>
      <p>Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Sleight of Hand</p>
      <p>Tool Proficiencies: Disguise Kit, Forgery kit</p>
      <p>Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a disguise kit, tools of the con of your choice (ten stoppered bottles filled with colored liquid, a set of weighted dice, a deck of marked cards, or a signet ring of an imaginary duke), and a belt pouch containing 60 septims. </p>

      <p>FAVORITE SCHEMES</p>
      <p>Every charlatan has an angle she or he uses in preference to other schemes. Choose a favorite scam or roll on the table below. </p>

      <p>FEATURE: FALSE IDENTITY</p>
      <p>You have created a second identity that includes documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona.    Additionally, you can forge documents including official papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or the handwriting you are trying to copy. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</p>
      <p>Charlatans are colorful characters who conceal their true selves behind the masks they construct. They reflect what people want to see, what they want to believe, and how they see the world. But their true selves are sometimes plagued by an uneasy conscience, an old enemy, or deep-seated trust issues. </p>

      <p>CITY WATCH</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Refer to the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide page 145 for more information.</p>
      <p>You have served the community where you grew up, standing as its first line of defense against crime. You aren't a soldier, directing your gaze outward at possible enemies. Instead, your service to your hometown was to help police its populace, protecting the citizenry from lawbreakers and malefactors of every stripe. </p>
      <p>You might have been part of the City Watch of Daggerfall, protecting the common folk from thieves and rowdy nobility alike. Or you might have been one of the valiant defenders of the Imperial City, or even one of the magic-wielding spell guards. Perhaps you hail from Sentinel and have served as an Alik'r Warrior. </p>
      <p>Even if you're not city-born or city-bred, this background can describe your early years as a member of law enforcement. Most settlements of any size have their own constables and police forces, and even smaller communities have sheriffs and bailiffs who stand ready to protect their community. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Insight</p>
      <p>Languages: Two of your choice</p>
      <p>Equipment: A uniform in the style of your unit and indicative of your rank, a horn with which to summon help, a set of manacles, and a pouch containing 40 septims.</p>

      <p/>
      <p>FEATURE: WATCHER'S EYE</p>
      <p>Your experience in enforcing the law, and dealing with lawbreakers, gives you a feel for local laws and criminals. You can easily find the local outpost of the watch or a similar organization, and just as easily pick out the dens of criminal activity in a community, although you're more likely to be welcome in the former locations rather than the latter.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>VARIANT: INVESTIGATOR</p>
      <p>Rarer than watch or patrol members are a community's investigators, who are responsible for solving crimes after the fact. Though such folk a re seldom found in rural areas, nearly every settlement of decent size has at least one or two watch members who have the skill to investigate crime scenes and track down criminals. If your prior experience is as an investigator, you have proficiency in Investigation rather than Athletics.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</p>
      <p>Use the tables for the soldier background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of the city watch.</p>
      <p>Your bond is likely associated with your fellow watch members or the watch organization itself and almost certainly concerns your community. Your ideal probably involves the fostering of peace and safety. An investigator is likely to have an ideal connected to achieving justice by successfully solving crimes.</p>

      <p>CLAN CRAFTER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Refer to the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide page 145 for more information.</p>
      <p>The Pariah Folk are well known for their artisanship and the worth of their handiworks, and you have been trained in their ancient tradition. For years you labored under an orc master of the craft, enduring long hours and dismissive, sour-tempered treatment in order to gain the fine skills you possess today.</p>
      <p>You are most likely an orc, but not necessarily – particularly in the North, where the harsh environments create a mutual respect between those who choose to live there. If you aren't an orc, however, you have taken a solemn oath never to take on an apprentice in the craft: it is not for non-orcs to pass on the skills of Malacath's favored children. You would have no difficulty, however, finding an orc master who was willing to receive potential apprentices who came with your recommendation.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Skill Proficiencies: History, Insight</p>
      <p>Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan's tools</p>
      <p>Languages: Orcish or one other of your choice if you already speak Orcish.</p>
      <p>Equipment: A set of artisan's tools with which you are proficient, a maker's mark chisel used to mark your handiwork with the symbol of the clan of crafters you learned your skill from, a set of traveler's clothes, and a pouch containing 20 septims and a gem worth 40 septims.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>FEATURE: RESPECT OF THE PARIAH FOLK</p>
      <p>As well respected as clan crafters are among outsiders, no one esteems them quite so highly as orcs do. You always have free room and board in any place where orcs dwell, and the individuals in such a settlement might vie among themselves to determine who can offer you (and possibly your compatriots) the finest accommodations and assistance. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</p>
      <p>Use the tables for the guild artisan background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a clan crafter. (For example, consider the words “guild” and “clan” to be interchangeable.)</p>
      <p>Your bond is almost certainly related to the master or the clan that taught you, or else to the work that you produce. Your ideal might have to do with maintaining the high quality of your work or preserving the orc traditions of craftmanship.</p>
      <p>CLOISTERED SCHOLAR</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Refer to the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide page 146 for more information.</p>
      <p>As a child, you were inquisitive when your playmates were possessive or raucous. In your formative years, you found your way to one of Tamriel's great institutes of learning, where you were apprenticed and taught that knowledge is a more valuable treasure than gold or gems. Now you are ready to leave your home – not to abandon it, but to quest for new lore to add to its storehouse of knowledge. </p>
      <p>The most well known of Tamriel's fonts of knowledge is the Elder Library within White-Gold Tower. The great library is always in need of workers and attendants, some of whom rise through the ranks to assume roles of greater responsibility and prominence. You might be one of the Elder Library's own, dedicated to the curatorship of what is likely the most complete body of lore and history in all the world. </p>
      <p>Perhaps instead you were taken in by the scholars of the Crystal Tower, and now you have struck out to increase your knowledge and to make yourself available to help those in other places who seek your expertise.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Skill Proficiencies: History, plus your choice of one from among Arcana, Nature, or Religion</p>
      <p>Languages: Two of your choice</p>
      <p>Equipment: The scholar's robes of your cloister, a writing kit (small pouch with a quill, ink, folded parchment, and a small penknife), a borrowed book on the subject of your current study, and a pouch containing 40 septims.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>FEATURE: LIBRARY ACCESS</p>
      <p>Though others must often endure extensive interviews and significant fees to gain access to even the most common archives in your library, you have free and easy access to the majority of the library, though it might also have repositories of lore that are too valuable, magical,or secret to permit anyone immediate access.</p>
      <p>You have a working knowledge of your cloister's personnel and bureaucracy, and you know how to navigate those connections with some ease. </p>
      <p>Additionally, you are likely to gain preferential treatment at other libraries across the provinces, as professional courtesy shown to a fellow scholar. </p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</p>
      <p>Use the tables for the sage background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a cloistered scholar.</p>
      <p>Your bond is almost certainly associated either with the place where you grew up or with the knowledge you hope to acquire through adventuring. Your ideal is no doubt related to how you view the quest for knowledge and truth – perhaps as a worthy goal in itself, or maybe as a means to a desirable end.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>COURTIER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Refer to the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide page 146 for more information.</p>
      <p>In your earlier days, you were a personage of some significance in a noble court or a bureaucratic organization. You might or might not come from an upper-class family; your talents, rather than the circumstances of your birth, could have secured you this position. </p>
      <p>You might have been one of the many functionaries, attendants, and other hangers-on in the Court of Wayrest, or perhaps you traveled in the Imperial City's baroque and sometimes cutthroat conglomeration of guilds, nobles, adventurers, and secret societies. You might have been one of the behind-the-scenes law-keepers or functionaries in Sentinel or Mournhold, or you might have grown up in and around the castle of Daggerfall. </p>
      <p>Even if you are no longer a full-fledged member of the group that gave you your start in life, your relationships with your former fellows can be an advantage for you and your adventuring comrades. You might undertake missions with your new companions that further the interest of the organization that gave you your start in life. In any event, the abilities that you honed while serving as a courtier will stand you in good stead as an adventurer. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Persuasion</p>
      <p>Languages: Two of your choice</p>
      <p>Equipment: A set of fine clothes and a pouch containing 20 septims.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>FEATURE: COURT FUNCTIONARY</p>
      <p>Your knowledge of how bureaucracies function lets you gain access to the records and inner workings of any noble court or government you encounter. You know who the movers and shakers are, whom to go to for the favors you seek, and what the current intrigues of interest in the group are. </p>
      <p>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</p>
      <p>Use the tables for the guild artisan background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a courtier.</p>
      <p>The noble court or bureaucratic organization where you got your start is directly or indirectly associated with your bond (which could pertain to certain individuals in the group, such as your sponsor or mentor). Your ideals might be concerned with the prevailing philosophy of your court or organization.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CRIMINAL</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Refer to the Player's Handbook page 129 for more information.</p>
      <p>You are an experienced criminal with a history of breaking the law. You have spent a lot of time among other criminals and still have contacts within the criminal underworld.You’re far closer than most people to the world of murder, theft, and violence that pervades the underbelly of civilization, and you have survived up to this point by flouting the rules and regulations of society. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Stealth</p>
      <p>Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set, thieves' tools</p>
      <p>Equipment: A crowbar, a set of dark common clothes including a hood, and a belt pouch containing 60 septims.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CRIMINAL SPECIALITY</p>
      <p>There are many kinds of criminals, and within a thieves' guild or similar criminal organization, individual members have particular specialties. Even criminals who operate outside of such organizations have strong preferences for certain kinds of crimes over others. Choose the role you played in your criminal life, or roll on the table below.</p>

      <p>You have a reliable and trustworthy contact who acts as your liaison to a network of other criminals. You know how to get messages to and from your contact, even over great distances; specifically, you know the local messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can deliver messages for you. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</p>
      <p>Criminals might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are villainous to the core. But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics.</p>
      <p>There might be honor among thieves, but criminals rarely show any respect for law or authority. </p>

      <p>VARIANT CRIMINAL: SPY</p>
      <p>Although your capabilities are not much different from those of a burglar or smuggler, you learned and practiced them in a very different context: as an espionage agent. You might have been an officially sanctioned agent of the crown, or perhaps you sold the secrets you uncovered to the highest bidder. </p>

Your dance steps captivate, your humor cuts to the quick. Whatever techniques you use, your art is your life. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>Skill Proficiencies: Acrobatics, Performance</p>
      <p>Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit, musical instrument of your choice</p>

      <p>FEATURE: BY POPULAR DEMAND</p>
      <p>You can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or even in a noble’s court.</p>
      <p>At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</p>
      <p>Successful entertainers have to be able to capture and hold an audience’s attention, so they tend to have flamboyant or forceful personalities. They’re inclined toward the romantic and often cling to high-minded ideals about the practice of art and the appreciation of beauty. </p>

      <p>VARIANT: GLADIATOR</p>
      <p>A gladiator is as much an entertainer as any minstrel or circus performer, trained to make the arts of combat into a spectacle the crowd can enjoy. This kind of flashy combat is your entertainer routine, though you might also have some skills as a tumbler or actor. Using your By Popular Demand feature, you can find a place to perform in any place that features combat for entertainment—perhaps a gladiatorial arena or secret pit fighting club.</p>
      <p>You can replace the musical instrument in your equipment package with an inexpensive but unusual weapon, such as a trident or net.         </p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>FACTION AGENT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Refer to the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide page 147 for more information.</p>
      <p>Many organizations active in Tamriel aren't bound by strictures of geography. These factions pursue their agendas without regard for political boundaries, and their members operate anywhere the organization deems necessary. These groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers, sellswords, cache-holders (people who guard caches of wealth or magic for use by the faction's operatives), haven keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few. At the core of every faction are those who don't merely fulfill a small function for that organization, but who serve as its hands, head, and heart. </p>
      <p>As a prelude to your adventuring career (and in preption for it), you served as an agent of a particular faction in Tamriel. You might have operated openly or secretly, depending on the faction and its goals, as well as how those goals mesh with your own. Becoming an adventurer doesn't necessarily require you to relinquish membership in your faction (though you can choose to do so), and it might enhance your status in the faction. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>Skill Proficiencies: Insight and one Intelligence, Willpower, or Personality skill of your choice, as appropriate to your faction.</p>
      <p>Languages: Two of your choice</p>
      <p>Equipment: Badge or emblem of your faction, a copy of a seminal faction text (or a code-book for a covert faction), a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 60 septims.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>FACTIONS OF TAMRIEL</p>
      <p>Tamriel is home to many factions, however, there are a handful of groups that have made a large impression on society. If your background is as an agent of one of the main factions of Tamriel, here are some possibilities. </p>
      <p>The Fighters Guild. Found throughout most of Tamriel, The Fighter's Guild was founded in the 2nd era as an Akaviri-only organization, but has since opened up to all the races. The guild is a professional group, chartered by the Emperor, that regulates the hiring of mercenaries, protectors, and guards. Agents of the guild are often proficient in Athletics, and seek aid from other guild members, local guards, and members of the Imperial Legion. Operatives may find themselves ensuring other mercenary groups adhere to the law, or try to uncover corruption within the guild. </p>
      <p>The Mages Guild. Although the traditional guild was dissolved in the 4th era, other groups of mages, such as the Synod and the College of Whispers have continued on the tradition of studying the mysteries and applications of magicka. Those who serve the Mages Guild are masters of Arcana, and seek assistance from scholars and sages. Operatives for the guild may be in search of powerful magical artifacts, or be watchful of wizards practicing forbidden magic.</p>
      <p>The Thieves Guild. Although thieves are criminals by definition, the guild is tolerated by local authorities for its role as a crime regulator. The guild prevents unregulated competition and does not allow egregious activities by its own members. Members are typically skilled at deception and other thieving skills. They seek aid from other mercenaries, wizards, and merchants allied with the Thieves Guild, and sometimes even the shadowy Dark Brotherhood.</p>
      <p>The Imperial Legion. Also known as the Imperial Army and the Ruby Ranks, the Legion is the main force of the Empire. Considered to be one of the best armies assembled in history, the Legion preserves peace and rule of law throughout the Empire. Members are required to be knowledgeable in Lore, and can always rely on the aid of governments that are part of the Empire, plus other leaders and groups who uphold the legions ideals.</p>
      <p>The Imperial Cult. Worshipers of the Eight divines, they provide missionary work of their faith and bring divine inspiration and consolation across the Empire. Agents of the cult search out necromancers and daedra worshipers, and are usually skilled in Lore or Arcana. They seek aid from law enforcement friendly to the Empire, and clergy faithful to the Eight.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>FEATURE: SAFE HAVEN</p>
      <p>As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs and passwords you can use to identify such operatives, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information. These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true identities. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</p>
      <p>Use the tables for the acolyte background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a faction agent. (For instance, consider the words “faith” and “faction” to be interchangeable.)</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Your bond might be associated with other members of your faction, or a location or an object that is important to your faction. The ideal you strive for is probably in keeping with the tenets and principles of your faction, but might be more personal in nature.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>FOLK HERO</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Refer to the Player's Handbook page 131 for more information.</p>
      <p>You come from a humble social rank, but you are destined for so much more. Already the people of your home village regard you as their champion, and your destiny calls you to stand against the tyrants and monsters that threaten the common folk everywhere. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>Skill Proficiencies: Animal Handling, Survival</p>
      <p>Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan's tools, land vehicles</p>
      <p>Equipment: A set of artisan's tools (one of your choice), a shovel, an iron pot, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 40 septims.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>DEFINING EVENT</p>
      <p>You previously pursued a simple profession among the peasantry, perhaps as a farmer, miner, servant, shepherd, woodcutter, or gravedigger. But something happened that set you on a different path and marked you for greater things. Choose or randomly determine a defining event that marked you as a hero of the people. </p>

      <p>FEATURE: RUSTIC HOSPITALITY</p>
      <p>Since you come from the ranks of the common folk, you fit in among them with ease. You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate among other commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives for you. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</p>
      <p>A folk hero is one of the common people, for better or for worse. Most folk heroes look on their humble origins as a virtue, not a shortcoming, and their home communities remain very important to them. </p>

      <p>GUILD ARTISAN</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Refer to the Player's Handbook page 132 for more information.</p>
      <p>You are a member of an artisan’s guild, skilled in a particular field and closely associated with other artisans. You are a well-established part of the mercantile world, freed by talent and wealth from the constraints of a feudal social order. You learned your skills as an apprentice to a master artisan, under the sponsorship of your guild, until you became a master in your own right. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Persuasion</p>
      <p>Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan's tools </p>
      <p>Languages: One of your choice</p>
      <p>Equipment: A set of artisan's tools (one of your choice), a letter of introduction from your guild, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 60 septims.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>GUILD BUSINESS</p>
      <p>Guilds are generally found in cities large enough to support several artisans practicing the same trade. However, your guild might instead be a loose network of artisans who each work in a different village within a larger realm. Work with your DM to determine the nature of your guild. You can select your guild business from the Guild Business table or roll randomly. </p>

      <p>As a member of your guild, you know the skills needed to create finished items from raw materials (reflected in your proficiency with a certain kind of artisan’s tools), as well as the principles of trade and good business practices. The question now is whether you abandon your trade for adventure, or take on the extra effort to weave adventuring and trade together. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>FEATURE: GUILD MEMBERSHIP</p>
      <p>As an established and respected member of a guild, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.    Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild’s coffers.    You must pay dues of 20 septims per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild’s good graces. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</p>
      <p>Guild artisans are among the most ordinary people in the world—until they set down their tools and take up an adventuring career. They understand the value of hard work and the importance of community, but they’re vulnerable to sins of greed and covetousness. </p>

      <p>VARIANT GUILD ARTISAN: GUILD MERCHANT</p>
      <p>Instead of an artisans’ guild, you might belong to a guild of traders, caravan masters, or shopkeepers. You don’t craft items yourself but earn a living by buying and selling the works of others (or the raw materials artisans need to practice their craft). Your guild might be a large merchant consortium (or family) with interests across the region. Perhaps you transported goods from one place to another, by ship, wagon, or caravan, or bought them from traveling traders and sold them in your own little shop. In some ways, the traveling merchant’s life lends itself to adventure far more than the life of an artisan.    Rather than proficiency with artisan’s tools, you might be proficient with navigator’s tools or an additional language. And instead of artisan’s tools, you can start with a mule and a cart. </p>

      <p>HAUNTED ONE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Refer to the Curse of Strahd page 209 for more information.</p>
      <p>You are haunted by something so terrible that you dare not speak of it. You’ve tried to bury it and flee from it, to no avail. This thing that haunts you can’t be slain with a sword or banished with a spell. It might come to you as a shadow on the wall, a bloodcurdling nightmare, a memory that refuses to die, or a demonic whisper in the dark. The burden has taken its toll, isolating you from others and making you question your sanity. You must find a way to overcome it before it destroys you. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>Skill Proficiencies: Choose one of Arcana, Investigation, Religion, or Survival</p>
      <p>Languages: Choose one exotic language</p>
      <p>Equipment: A monster hunter’s pack, a set of common clothes, and one trinket of special significance </p>
      <p/>
      <p>FEATURE: HEART OF DARKNESS</p>
      <p>Those who look into your eyes can see that you have faced unimaginable horror and that you are no stranger to darkness. Though they might fear you, commoners will extend you every courtesy and do their utmost to help you. Unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them, they will even take up arms to fight alongside you, should you find yourself facing an enemy alone. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>HARROWING EVENT</p>
      <p>Prior to becoming an adventurer, your path in life was defined by one dark moment, one fateful decision, or one tragedy. Now you feel a darkness threatening to consume you, and you fear there may be no hope of escape. Choose a harrowing event that haunts you, or roll one on the Harrowing Events table. </p>

      <p>HERMIT</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Refer to the Player's Handbook page 134 for more information.</p>
      <p>You lived in seclusion—either in a sheltered community such as a monastery, or entirely alone—for a formative part of your life. In your time apart from the clamor of society, you found quiet, solitude, and perhaps some of the answers you were looking for. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>Skill Proficiencies: Medicine, Religion</p>
      <p>Tool Proficiencies: Herbalism Kit</p>
      <p>Languages: One of your choice</p>
      <p>Equipment: A scroll case stuffed full of notes from your studies or prayers, a winter blanket, a set of common clothes, an herbalism kit, and 20 septims.</p>
      <p/>

      <p>What was the reason for your isolation, and what changed to allow you to end your solitude? You can work with your DM to determine the exact nature of your seclusion, or you can choose or roll on the table below to determine the reason behind your seclusion. </p>

      <p>FEATURE: DISCOVERY</p>
      <p>The quiet seclusion of your extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. The exact nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosmos, the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or the forces of nature.It could be a site that no one else has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has long been forgotten, or unearthed some relic of the past that could rewrite history. It might be information that would be damaging to the people who or consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society.</p>
      <p>Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on the campaign. </p>
      <p>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</p>
      <p>Some hermits are well suited to a life of seclusion, whereas others chafe against it and long for company. Whether they embrace solitude or long to escape it, the solitary life shapes their attitudes and ideals. A few are driven slightly mad by their years apart from society. </p>

      <p>OTHER HERMITS</p>
      <p>This hermit background assumes a contemplative sort of seclusion that allows room for study and prayer. If you want to play a rugged wilderness recluse who lives off the land while shunning the company of other people, look at the outlander background. On the other hand, if you want to go in a more religious direction, the acolyte might be what you’re looking for. Or you could even be a charlatan, posing as a wise and holy person and letting pious fools support you. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>IMPERIAL CITY NOBLE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Refer to the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide page 154 for more information.</p>
      <p>You are a scion of one of the great noble families of the Imperial City. Human families who jealously guard their privilege and place in the City of Splendors, Imperial City nobles have a reputation across Tamriel for being eccentric, spoiled, venal, and, above all else, rich. </p>
      <p>Whether you are a shining example of the reason for this reputation or one who proves the rule by being an exception, people expect things of you when they know your surname and what it means. Your reasons for taking up adventuring likely involve your family in some way: Are you the family rebel, who prefers delving in filthy dungeons to sipping brandy at a ball? Or have you taken up sword or spell on your family's behalf, ensuring that they have someone of renown to see to their legacy? </p>
      <p>Work with your DM to come up with the family you are part of, with its own financial interests, specialties, and schemes. You might be part of the main line of your family, possibly in line to become its leader one day. Or you might be one of any number of cousins, with less prestige but also less responsibility. </p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>Skill Proficiencies: History, Persuasion</p>
      <p>Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set or one musical instrument</p>
      <p>Languages: One of your choice</p>
      <p>Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a signet ring or brooch, a scroll of pedigree, a skin of fine brandy or wine, and a purse containing 80 septims</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>FEATURE: KEPT IN STYLE</p>
      <p>While you are in the Imperial City or elsewhere in Cyrodiil your house sees to your everyday needs. Your name and signet are sufficient to cover most of your expenses; the inns, taverns, and feast halls you frequent are glad to record your debt and send an accounting to your family's estate in the Imperial City to settle what you owe. </p>
      <p>This advantage enables you to live a comfortable lifestyle without having to pay 2 gp a day for it, or reduces the cost of a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle by that amount. You may not maintain a less affluent lifestyle and use the difference as income-the benefit is a line of credit, not an actual monetary reward.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</p>
      <p>Use the tables for the noble background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of an Imperial City family. </p>
      <p>Like other nobles, you were born and raised in a different world from the one that most folk know – one that grants you privilege but also calls you to fulfill a duty befitting your station, or it could be concerned with another noble house that sides with or opposes your own. Your ideal depends to some extent on how you view your role in the family, and how you intend to conduct yourself in the world at large as a representative of your house.</p>

      <p>INHERITOR</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Refer to the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide page 150 for more information.</p>
      <p>You are the heir to something of great value–not mere coin or wealth, but an object that has been entrusted to you and you alone. Your inheritance might have come directly to you from a member of your family, by right of birth, or it could have been left to you by a friend, a mentor, a teacher, or someone else important in your life. The revelation of your inheritance changed your life, and might have set you on the path to adventure, but it could also come with many dangers, including those who covet your gift and want to take it from you–by force, if need be. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>Skill Proficiencies: Survival, plus one from among Arcana, History, or Religion</p>
      <p>Tool Proficiencies: You choice of a gaming set or a musical instrument.</p>
      <p>Languages: Any one of your choice</p>
      <p>Equipment: Your inheritance, a set of traveler's clothes, any times with which you are proficient, and a pouch containing 60 septims.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>FEATURE: INHERITANCE</p>
      <p>Choose or randomly determine your inheritance from among the possibilities in the table below. Work with your Dungeon Master to come up with details: Why is your inheritance so important, and what is its full story? You might prefer for the DM to invent these details as part of the game, allowing you to learn more about your inheritance as your character does. </p>
      <p>The Dungeon Master is free to use your inheritance as a story hook, sending you on quests to learn more about its history or true nature, or confronting you with foes who want to claim it for themselves or prevent you from learning what you seek. The DM also determines the properties of your inheritance and how they figure into the item's history and importance. For instance, the object might be a minor magic item, or one that begins with a modest ability and increases in potency with the passage of time. Or, the true nature of your inheritance might not be apparent at first and is revealed only when certain conditions are met. </p>
      <p>    When you begin your adventuring career, you can decide whether to tell your companions about your inheritance right away. Rather than attracting attention to yourself, you might want to keep your inheritance a secret until you learn more about what it means to you and what it can do for you. </p>

      <p>Use the tables for the folk hero background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as an inheritor. </p>
      <p>Your bond might be directly related to your inheritance, or to the person from who you received it. Your ideal might be influenced by what you know about your inheritance, or by what you intend to do with your gift once you realize what it is capable of.</p>

      <p>KNIGHT OF THE ORDER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Refer to the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide page 151 for more information.</p>
      <p>You belong to an order of knights who have sworn oaths to achieve a certain goal. The nature of this goal depends on the order you serve, but in your eyes it is without question a vital and honorable endeavor. Tamriel has a wide variety of knightly orders, all of which have a similar outlook concerning their actions and responsibilities. </p>
      <p>Though the term "knight" conjures ideas of mounted, heavily armored warriors of noble blood, most knightly orders in Tamriel don't restrict their membership to such individuals. The goals and philosophies of the order are more important than the gear and fighting style of its members, and so most of these orders aren't limited to fighting types, but are open to all sorts of folk who are willing to battle and die for the order's cause. </p>
      <p>The "Knightly Orders of Tamriel" below details several of the orders that are active at present and is designed to help inform your decision about which group you owe allegiance to. </p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>Skill Proficiencies: Persuasion, plus one from among Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion, as appropriate for your order.</p>
      <p>Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set or musical instrument</p>
      <p>Languages: One of your choice</p>
      <p>Equipment: One set of traveler's clothes, a signet, banner, or seal representing your place or rank in the order, and a pouch containing 40 septims.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>FEATURE: KNIGHTLY REGARD</p>
      <p>You receive shelter and succor from members of your knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its aims. If your order is a religious one, you can gain aid from temples and other religious communities of your deity. Knights of civic orders can get help from the community – whether a lone settlement or a great nation that they serve, and knights of philosophical orders can find help from those they have aided in pursuit of their ideals, and those who share those ideals. </p>
      <p>This help comes in the form of shelter and meals, and healing when appropriate, as well as occasionally risky assistance, such as a band of local citizens rallying to aid a sorely pressed knight in a fight, or those who support the order helping to smuggle a knight out of town when they are being hunted unjustly.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>KNIGHTLY ORDERS OF TAMRIEL</p>
      <p>Many who rightfully call themselves "knight" earn that title as part of an order in service to a deity, such as the Vigil of Stendarr, or the Order of Arkay with their Knights of the Circle. Other knightly orders serve a government, royal family, or are the elite military of a feudal state, such as the Order of the Raven. Other knighthoods are secular and non governmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an order of monks. Although there are organizations, such as the Order of the Lily, that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors, most folk of Tamriel who hear the word "knight" think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code. Below are a few knightly organizations. </p>
      <p>Knights of the Dragon. The Knights of the Dragon are the elite soldiers who are the official protectors of the city and royal family of Daggerfall. Sometimes they are confused as members of the Dragonguard, but they were not created to slay dragons. Their service is to His Majesty the Dragon, or rather, the current King or Queen of Daggerfall. Many knights are stationed in and around Daggerfall for protection of the crown, but many find themselves outside of High Rock, escorting nobles, or gathering information from their allies and enemies. These knights follow their oath: I vow to serve the Dragon. I lay down my life, my gold, and my sacred honor for my King. His word is my order, my sword is his arm. Our lives are one.</p>
      <p>Knights of the Flame. Centuries ago, noble warriors of the Lorddom of Anticlere held back the invading armies of the Reach when Sir Byric set the fields surrounding the Alcaire Castle on fire. This bold action led to the Alcaire Knights to be known as the Knights of the Flame. Those who devote themselves to Anticlere and their blessed patrons are judged as worthy to join the order, and in return, the knights are treated as gods by the locals.</p>
      <p>Knights of the Thorn. The Knights of the Thorn are a chivalrous order dedicated to the protection of Cheydinhal, in Cyrodiil. Founded by Farwil Indarys, the group began as a glorified club, which spent more time drinking ale than they did doing anything else. However, shortly after their inception, tragedy came to the region and the Knights proved their worth, fending off several daedric invasions. The order's crest is a sword enveloped in thorns, a symbol of the Indarys family. Every member of the order wears a special medallion, or is outfitted in armor and weapons emblazoned with their coat-of-arms.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</p>
      <p>Use the tables for the soldier background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a knight of your order. </p>
      <p>Your bond almost always involves the order to which you belong (or at least key members of it), and it is highly unusual for a knight's ideal not to reflect the agenda, sentiment, or philosophy of one's order.</p>

      <p>MERCENARY VETERAN</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Refer to the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide page 152 for more information.</p>
      <p>As a sellsword who fought battles for coin, you're well acquainted with risking life and limb for a chance at a share of treasure. Now, you look forward to fighting foes and reaping even greater rewards as an adventurer. Your experience makes you familiar with the ins and outs of mercenary life, and you likely have harrowing stories of events on the battlefield. You might have served with a large outfit such as the Fighter's Guild or the Companions, or a smaller band of sellswords, maybe even more than one.</p>
      <p>Now you're looking for something else, perhaps greater reward for the risks you take, or the freedom to choose your own activities. For whatever reason, you're leaving behind the life of a soldier for hire, but your skills are undeniably suited for battle, so now you fight on in a different way. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Persuasion</p>
      <p>Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set, vehicles (land)</p>
      <p>Equipment: A uniform of your company (traveler's clothes in quality, an insignia of your rank, a gaming set of your choice, and a pouch containing the remainder of your last wages (40 septims)</p>
      <p/>
      <p>FEATURE: MERCENARY LIFE</p>
      <p>You know the mercenary life as only someone who has experienced it can. You are able to identify mercenary companies by their emblems, and you know a little about any such company, including the names and reputations of its commanders and leaders, and who has hired them recently. You can find the taverns and feast halls where mercenaries abide in any area, as long as you speak the language. You can find mercenary work between adventures sufficient to maintain a comfortable lifestyle (see "Practicing a Profession" under "Downtime Activities" in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook).</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</p>
      <p>Use the tables for the soldier background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a mercenary. </p>
      <p>Your bond could be associated with the company you traveled with previously, or with some of the comrades you served with. The ideal you embrace largely depends on your worldview and your motivation for fighting.</p>
      <p>NOBLE </p>
      <p>
         <p/>Refer to the Player's Handbook page 135 for more information.</p>
      <p>You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them. </p>
      <p>Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn’t stand on its own—it’s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you. </p>
      <p>Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them? </p>
      <p>What’s your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don’t embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family’s good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family? </p>
      <p>Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your line or even a spiritual member of the family? </p>
      <p>These details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>Skill Proficiencies: History, Persuasion </p>
      <p>Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set</p>
      <p>Languages: One of your choice</p>
      <p>Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a signet ring, a scroll of pedigree, and a purse containing 100 septims.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>FEATURE: POSITION OF PRIVILEGE</p>
      <p>Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</p>
      <p>Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family’s care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble. </p>

      <p>VARIANT NOBLE: KNIGHT</p>
      <p>A knighthood is among the lowest noble titles in most societies, but it can be a path to higher status. If you wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature instead of the Position of Privilege feature. One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps you put it on). </p>
      <p>As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart—in a chaste sort of devotion. (This person could be your bond.) </p>
      <p/>
      <p>VARIANT FEATURE: RETAINER</p>
      <p>If your character has a noble background, you may select this background feature instead of Position of Privilege. </p>
      <p>You have the service of three retainers loyal to your family. These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one might be a majordomo. Your retainers are commoners who can perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight for you, will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if they are frequently endangered or abused. </p>

      <p>OUTLANDER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Refer to the Player's Handbook page 136 for more information.</p>
      <p>You grew up in the wilds, far from civilization and the comforts of town and technology. You’ve witnessed the migration of herds larger than forests, survived weather more extreme than any city-dweller could comprehend, and enjoyed the solitude of being the only thinking creature for miles in any direction. The wilds are in your blood, whether you were a nomad, an explorer, a recluse, a hunter-gatherer, or even a marauder. Even in places where you don’t know the specific features of the terrain, you know the ways of the wild. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Survival</p>
      <p>Tool Proficiencies: One type of musical Instrument </p>
      <p>Languages: One of your choice</p>
      <p>Equipment: A staff, a hunting trap, a trophy from an animal you killed, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 40 septims.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ORIGIN</p>
      <p>You've been to strange places and seen things that others cannot begin to fathom. Consider some of the distant lands you have visited, and how they impacted you. You can roll on the following table to determine your occupation during your time in the wild, or choose one that best fits your character. </p>

      <p>FEATURE: WANDERER</p>
      <p>You have an excellent memory for maps and geography, and you can always recall the general layout of terrain, settlements, and other features around you. In addition, you can find food and fresh water for yourself and up to five other people each day, provided that the land offers berries, small game, water, and so forth. </p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</p>
      <p>Often considered rude and uncouth among civilized folk, outlanders have little respect for the niceties of life in the cities. The ties of tribe, clan, family, and the natural world of which they are a part are the most important bonds to most outlanders. </p>

      <p>FEATURE: RESEARCHER</p>
      <p>When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of Tamriel can require an adventure or even a whole campaign. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</p>
      <p>Sages are defined by their extensive studies, and their characteristics reflect this life of study. Devoted to scholarly pursuits, a sage values knowledge highly—sometimes in its own right, sometimes as a means toward other ideals. </p>

      <p>SAILOR</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Refer to the Player's Handbook page 139 for more information.</p>
      <p>You sailed on a seagoing vessel for years. In that time, you faced down mighty storms, monsters of the deep, and those who wanted to sink your craft to the bottomless depths. Your first love is the distant line of the horizon, but the time has come to try your hand at something new.</p>
      <p>Discuss the nature of the ship you previously sailed with your Dungeon Master. Was it a merchant ship, a naval vessel, a ship of discovery, or a pirate ship? How famous (or infamous) is it? Is it widely traveled? Is it still sailing, or is it missing and presumed lost with all hands?</p>
      <p>What were your duties on board—boatswain, captain, navigator, cook, or some other position? Who were the captain and first mate? Did you leave your ship on good terms with your fellows, or on the run? </p>
      <p/>
      <p>Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Perception</p>
      <p>Tool Proficiencies: Navigator's tools, water vehicles</p>
      <p>Equipment: A belaying pin (club), 50 feet of silk rope, a lucky charm such as a rabbit foot or a small stone with a hole in the center (or you may roll for a random trinket on the Trinkets table in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook), a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 40 septims.</p>
      <p>FEATURE: SHIP'S PASSAGE</p>
      <p>When you need to, you can secure free passage on a sailing ship for yourself and your adventuring companions. You might sail on the ship you served on, or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps one captained by a former crewmate). Because you’re calling in a favor, you can’t be certain of a schedule or route that will meet your every need. Your Dungeon Master will determine how long it takes to get where you need to go. In return for your free passage, you and your companions are expected to assist the crew during the voyage. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</p>
      <p>Sailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of life on a ship make them generally reliable as well. Life aboard a ship shapes their outlook and forms their most important attachments. </p>

      <p>VARIANT SAILOR: PIRATE</p>
      <p>You spent your youth under the sway of a dread pirate, a ruthless cutthroat who taught you how to survive in a world of sharks and savages. You’ve indulged in larceny on the high seas and sent more than one deserving soul to a briny grave. Fear and bloodshed are no strangers to you, and you’ve garnered a somewhat unsavory reputation in many a port town.</p>
      <p>If you decide that your sailing career involved piracy, you can choose the Bad Reputation feature instead of the Ship’s Passage feature. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>VARIANT FEATURE: BAD REPUTATION</p>
      <p>If your character has a sailor background, you may select this background feature instead of Ship’s Passage.</p>
      <p>No matter where you go, people are afraid of you due to your reputation. When you are in a civilized settlement, you can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a tavern or breaking down doors at a local shop, since most people will not report your activity to the authorities.</p>

      <p>War has been your life for as long as you care to remember. You trained as a youth, studied the use of weapons and armor, learned basic survival techniques, including how to stay alive on the battlefield. You might have been part of a standing national army or a mercenary company, or perhaps a member of a local militia who rose to prominence during a recent war.</p>
      <p>When you choose this background, work with your DM to determine which military organization you were a part of, how far through its ranks you progressed, and what kind of experiences you had during your military career. Was it a standing army, a town guard, or a village militia? Or it might have been a noble’s or merchant’s private army, or a mercenary company. </p>

      <p>FEATURE: MILITARY RANK</p>
      <p>You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank. You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment or horses for temporary use. You can also usually gain access to friendly military encampments and fortresses where your rank is recognized. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</p>
      <p>The horrors of war combined with the rigid discipline of military service leave their mark on all soldiers, shaping their ideals, creating strong bonds, and often leaving them scarred and vulnerable to fear, shame, and hatred.</p>

      <p>URBAN BOUNTY HUNTER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Refer to the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide page 153 for more information.</p>
      <p>Before you became an adventurer, your life was already full of conflict and excitement, because you made a living tracking down people for pay. Unlike some people who collect bounties, though, you aren't a savage who follows quarry into or through the wilderness. You're involved in a lucrative trade, in the place where you live, that routinely tests your skills and survival instincts. What's more, you aren't alone, as a bounty hunter in the wild would be: you routinely interact with both the criminal subculture and other bounty hunters, maintaining contacts in both areas to help you succeed. </p>
      <p>You might be a cunning thief-catcher, prowling the rooftops to catch one of the myriad burglars of the city. Perhaps you are someone who has your ear to the street, aware of the doings of thieves' guilds and street gangs. You might be a "velvet mask" bounty hunter, one who blends in with high society and noble circles in order to catch the criminals that prey on the rich, whether pickpockets or con artists. The community where you plied your trade might have been one of Tamriels's great metropolises, such as the Imperial City, Daggerfall, or a less populous location, perhaps Stros M'kai or Whiterun – any place that's large enough to have a steady supply of potential quarries. </p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>As a member of an adventuring party, you might find it more difficult to pursue a personal agenda that doesn't fit with the group's objectives- but on the other hand, you can take down much more formidable targets with the help of your companions. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from among Deception, Insight, Persuasion, and Stealth</p>
      <p>Tool Proficiencies: Choose two from among one type of gaming set, one musical instrument, and thieves' tools</p>
      <p>Equipment: A set of clothes appropriate to your duties and a pouch containing 80 septims</p>
      <p/>
      <p>FEATURE: EAR TO THE GROUND</p>
      <p>You are in frequent contact with people in the segment of society that your chosen quarries move through. These people might be associated with the criminal underworld, the rough-and-tumble folk of the streets, or members of high society. This connection comes in the form of a contact in any city you visit, a person who provides information about the people and places of the local area.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</p>
      <p>Use the tables for the criminal background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a bounty hunter. </p>
      <p>For instance, your bond might involve other bounty hunters or the organizations or individuals that employ you. Your ideal could be associated with your determination  always to catch your quarry or your desire to maintain our reputation for being dependable.</p>

      <p>URCHIN</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Refer to the Player's Handbook page 141 for more information.</p>
      <p>You grew up on the streets alone, orphaned, and poor. You had no one to watch over you or to provide for you, so you learned to provide for yourself. You fought fiercely over food and kept a constant watch out for other desperate souls who might steal from you.You slept on rooftops and in alleyways, exposed to the elements, and endured sickness without the advantage of medicine or a place to recuperate. You’ve survived despite all odds, and did so through cunning, strength, speed, or some combination of each.</p>
      <p>You begin your adventuring career with enough money to live modestly but securely for at least ten days. How did you come by that money? What allowed you to break free of your desperate circumstances and embark on a better life? </p>
      <p/>
      <p>Skill Proficiencies: Sleight of Hand, Stealth</p>
      <p>Tool Proficiencies: Disguise Kit, Thieves' Tools</p>
      <p>Equipment: A small knife, a map of the city you grew up in, a pet mouse, a token to remember your parents by, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 40 septims.</p>

      <p>FEATURE: CITY SECRETS</p>
      <p>You know the secret patterns and flow to cities and can find passages through the urban sprawl that others would miss. When you are not in combat, you (and companions you lead) can travel between any two locations in the city twice as fast as your speed would normally allow. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</p>
      <p>Urchins are shaped by lives of desperate poverty, for good and for ill. They tend to be driven either by a commitment to the people with whom they shared life on the street or by a burning desire to find a better life—and maybe get some payback on all the rich people who treated them badly. </p>

   <p>CHAPTER 5: EQUIPMENT</p>
   <sect1 id="Section25">
      <p>The marketplace of a large city teems with buyers and sellers of many sorts: orc smiths and altmer woodcarvers, nord farmers and breton jewelers. In the largest cities, almost anything imaginable is offered for sale, from exotic spices and luxurious clothing to wicker baskets and practical swords.</p>
      <p>For an adventurer, the availability of armor, weapons,  backpacks, rope, and similar goods is of pmount importance, since proper equipment can mean the difference between life and death in a dungeon or the untamed wilds. This chapter details the mundane and exotic merchandise that adventurers commonly find useful in the face of the threats that the world of Tamriel presents.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>STARTING EQUIPMENT</p>
      <p>When you create your character, you will usually start an adventure in typical Elder Scrolls style, with nothing but rags. If you are joining an adventure that starts in another way or is already in progress, your DM can determine your starting gold based on your allies or by a combination of your class and background. Alternatively, you can start with a number of gold pieces based on your class and spend them on items from the lists in this chapter. See the Starting Wealth by Class table to determine how much gold you have to spend. You decide how your character came by this starting equipment. It might have been an inheritance, or goods that the character purchased during their upbringing. You might have been equipped with a weapon, armor, and a backpack as part of military service. You might even have stolen your gear. A weapon could be a family heirloom, passed down from generation to generation until your character finally took up the mantle and followed in an ancestor's adventurous footsteps. </p>

      <p>WEALTH</p>
      <p>The economy of Tamriel is based mainly on bartering. Although many merchants deal in coin, many will trade for goods and jewels. Larger cities may refuse to barter for goods and wish to deal strictly in Septims.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CURRENCY</p>
      <p>
         <p/>The main currency in Tamriel is the Septim. It is named that way from the Septim Empire that ruled Tamriel from the end of the 2nd era until the end of the 3rd era. It's called this due to the bust of Tiber Septim on the face of the coin. It is also sometimes referred to as Drakes, due to the seal of Akatosh on the back side.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SELLING TREASURE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot. </p>
      <p>Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment. As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough condition to sell. </p>
      <p>Magic Items. Selling magic items is problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn’t too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common magic items, you won’t normally come across magic items or spells to purchase. The value of magic is far beyond simple gold and should always be treated as such. </p>
      <p>Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects. These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the DM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first. </p>
      <p>Trade Goods. On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods—bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on—retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.</p>

      <p>ARMOR AND SHIELDS</p>
      <p>Tamriel is a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and septes them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.</p>
      <p>The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in the worlds of Tamriel.</p>
      <p>Armor Proficiency. Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Agility, and you can’t cast spells.</p>
      <p>Armor Class (AC). Armor protects its wearer from  attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.</p>
      <p>Heavy Armor. Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.</p>
      <p>Stealth. If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Agility (Stealth) checks.</p>
      <p>Shields. A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 1 or 2, depending on the type. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.</p>

                  <p>In most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment that you find on your adventures, within the bounds of common sense. For example, a burly orc won’t fit in a goblin's leather armor, and a bosmer would be swallowed up in a giant’s elegant robe.</p>
                  <p>The DM can impose more realism. For example, a suit of plate armor made for one human might not fit another one without significant alterations, and a guard’s uniform might be visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it as a disguise.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>LIGHT ARMOR</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Agility modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class. </p>
      <p>Padded. Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.</p>
      <p>Leather. The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials. </p>
      <p>Studded Leather. Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>MEDIUM ARMOR</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Agility modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.</p>
      <p>Hide. This crude armor consists of thick furs and  pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.</p>
      <p>Chain Shirt. Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer’s upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.</p>
      <p>Scale Mail. This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a septe skirt) of leather covered with. overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
      <p>Breastplate. This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer’s vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered. </p>
      <p>Half Plate. Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer’s body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>HEAVY ARMOR</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk. Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Agility modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Agility modifier is negative. </p>
      <p>Ring Mail. This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by those who can’t afford better armor. </p>
      <p>Chain Mail. Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
      <p>Splint. This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.</p>
      <p>Plate. Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.</p>

      <p>GETTING INTO AND OUT OF ARMOR</p>
      <p>
         <p/>The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor’s category.</p>
      <p>Don. This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor’s AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.</p>
      <p>Doff. This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half.</p>

      <p>WEAPONS</p>
      <p>Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class’s focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.</p>
      <p>The Common Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the world of Tamriel, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A melee weapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a ranged weapon is used to attack a target at a distance.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>WEAPON PROFICIENCY</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The categories are septed by they type of weapon: Blunt, Short Blade, Long Blade, Marksman, Axe, Polearms, and Hand-to-Hand. Being proficient with a type of weapon means you can use any weapon in that category with proficiency. Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>WEAPON PROPERTIES</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.</p>
      <p>Ammunition. You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</p>
      <p>If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see “Improvised Weapons” later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.</p>
      <p>Finesse. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Agility modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p>
      <p>Heavy. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.</p>
      <p>Light. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. See the rules for two-weapon fighting in chapter 9 of the Player's Handbook. </p>
      <p>Loading. Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p>
      <p>Range. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range. </p>
      <p>Reach. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it (see chapter 9). </p>
      <p>Special. A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s description (see “Special Weapons” later in this section).</p>
      <p>Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Agility, since the dagger has the finesse property. </p>
      <p>Two-Handed. This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it. </p>
      <p>Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>IMPROVISED WEAPONS</p>
      <p>Sometimes characters don’t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is close at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin. </p>
      <p>In many cases, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM’s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus. </p>
      <p>An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. </p>

      <p>COMMON WEAPONS</p>
      <p>There are many types of weapons that are common throughout Tamriel. These weapons can be simple clubs or daggers, complicated mechanical crossbows, and or skillful rapiers. The Common Weapons table can be used as a starting point, but other types of weapons can enhance the flavor of your campaign or character. When creating new weapons, consider a which common weapon would be the most similar to the one you are creating and use those properties, as described.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ADDITIONAL WEAPONS</p>
      <p>Some weapons, while not necessarily rare, are less common in the provinces of Tamriel. Akaviri style weapons and standard issue Legion arms might not be found in every town or sold by every merchant. The weapons found in the Additional Weapons table are inspired by many of these styles.</p>

      <p>SILVERED WEAPONS</p>
      <p>Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 400 septims. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SPECIAL WEAPONS</p>
      <p>Weapons with special rules are described here. </p>
      <p>Bola. A Large or smaller creature hit by a bola is restrained until it is freed. A bola has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the bola (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. </p>
      <p>Lance. You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren’t mounted. </p>
      <p>Net. A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. </p>
      <p>When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p>

      <p>TOOLS</p>
      <p>A tool helps you to do something you couldn’t otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For example, the DM might ask you to make an Agility check to carve a fine detail with your woodcarver’s tools, or a Strength check to make something out of particularly hard wood. You can find detailed descriptions in Chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook.</p>

      <p>MOUNTS AND VEHICLES</p>
      <p>A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down. The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each animal’s speed and base carrying capacity.</p>
      <p>An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together.</p>
      <p>Mounts other than those listed here are available in the world of Tamriel, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase. These include guar and senche, as wells as flying mounts, and even aquatic mounts. </p>
      <p>Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg and raising the creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.</p>
      <p>You can find detailed descriptions in Chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook.</p>

      <p>TRADE GOODS</p>
      <p>Most wealth is not in coins. It is measured in livestock, grain, land, rights to collect taxes, or rights to resources (such as a mine or a forest).</p>
      <p>Guilds, nobles, and royalty regulate trade. Chartered companies are granted rights to conduct trade along certain routes, to send merchant ships to various ports, or to buy or sell specific goods. Guilds set prices for the goods or services that they control, and determine who may or may not offer those goods and services. Merchants commonly exchange trade goods without using currency. The Trade Goods table shows the value of commonly exchanged goods.</p>

      <p>EXPENSES</p>
      <p>When not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins for lost treasures, or waging war against the encroaching darkness, adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others. </p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>LIFESTYLE EXPENSES</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.</p>
      <p>At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character’s career.</p>
      <p>Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.</p>

      <p>Wretched. You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people. </p>
      <p>Squalid. You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.</p>
      <p>Poor. A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types. </p>
      <p>Modest. A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don’t go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.</p>
      <p>Comfortable. Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middleclass neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers. </p>
      <p>Wealthy. Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle compble to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.</p>
      <p>Aristocratic. You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.</p>

      <p>individual food items and a single night’s lodging. These prices are included in your total lifestyle expenses.</p>

      <p>SERVICES</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.</p>
      <p>Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a mage might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the Leomund’s secret chest spell. A warrior might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke. </p>
      <p>Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a goblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation. Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.</p>

      <p>SPELLCASTING SERVICES</p>
      <p>
         <p/>People who are able to cast spells don’t fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs. </p>
      <p>Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as cure wounds or identify, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 40 to 100 septims (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment—the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement. </p>

      <p>TRINKETS</p>
      <p>When you make your character, you can roll once on the Trinkets table to gain a trinket, a simple item lightly touched by mystery. The DM might also use this table. It can help stock a room in a dungeon or fill a creature’s pockets. You can find the Trinkets table in Chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook.</p>

   <p>CHAPTER 6: CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS</p>
   <sect1 id="Section7">
      <p>The combination of ability scores, race, class, and background defines your character’s capabilities in the game, and the personal details you create set your character apart from every other character. Even within your class and race, you have options to fine-tune what your character can do. But a few players –  with the DM’s permission – want to go a step further.</p>
      <p>This chapter defines two optional sets of rules for customizing your character: multiclassing and feats. Multiclassing lets you combine classes together, and feats are special options you can choose instead of increasing your ability scores as you gain levels. Your DM decides whether these options are available in a campaign.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>MULTICLASSING</p>
      <p>Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options. </p>
      <p>With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in mage and two in warrior, you’re a 5th-level character. </p>
      <p>As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you’ll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.</p>

                  <p>Carlos is playing a 4th-level mage. When his character earns enough experience points to reach 5th level, Carlos decides that his character will multiclass instead of continuing to progress as a mage. Carlos' mage has been spending a lot of time with Luanne’s rogue, and has even been doing some jobs on the side for the local thieves’ guild as a transmuter. Carlos decides that his character will multiclass into the rogue class, and thus his character becomes a 4th-level mage and 1stlevel rogue (written as mage 4/rogue 1). </p>
                  <p>When Carlos' character earns enough experience to reach 6th level, he can decide whether to add another mage level (becoming a mage 5/rogue 1), another rogue level (becoming a mage 4/rogue 2), or a level in a third class, perhaps dabbling in warrior thanks to the tome of war he acquired (becoming a mage 4/rogue 1/ warrior 1).</p>

      <p>PREREQUISITES</p>
      <p>
         <p/>To qualify for a new class, you must meet the attribute score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a barbarian who decides to multiclass into the spellsword class must have both Strength and Willpower scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than- average attribute scores. </p>

      <p/>
      <p>EXPERIENCE POINTS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a crusader 6/warrior 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a warrior or your seventh level as a crusader.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>HIT POINTS AND HIT DICE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character. </p>
      <p>You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the warrior and the crusader have a d10, so if you are a crusader 5/warrior 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them septely. If you are a crusader 5/bard 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PROFICIENCY BONUS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not your level in a particular class.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PROFICIENCIES</p>
      <p>
         <p/>When you gain a level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of that class’s starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclass Proficiencies table.</p>

      <p>CLASS FEATURES</p>
      <p>
         <p/>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few feature have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Extra Attack, Unarmed Defense, and Spellcasting.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>EXTRA ATTACK</p>
      <p>If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don’t add together. You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the warrior’s version of Extra Attack does). </p>
      <p/>
      <p>UNARMORED DEFENSE</p>
      <p>If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can’t gain it again from another class.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>SPELLCASTING</p>
      <p>Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class. </p>
      <p>Spells Known and Prepared. You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a spellsword 4/mage 3, for example, you know three cantrips and five 1st-level spellsword spells based on your levels in the spellsword class. As 3rd-level mage, you know three mage cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten mage spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a mage) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six mage spells from your spellbook. </p>
      <p>Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. </p>
      <p>Magicka. You determine your available magicka by adding together all your levels in the bard, mage, and classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the crusader and spellsword classes, Use this total to determine your magicka by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table. </p>
      <p>Night Magic. If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Night Magic class feature from the nightblade class, you can use the unique spells you gain from the Night Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use magicka you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast nightblade spells you know.</p>

      <p>FEATS</p>
      <p>A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. See chapter 6 of the Player’s Handbook for more information. </p>
      <p>At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat’s description says otherwise. </p>
      <p>You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite.</p>

      <p>RACIAL FEATS</p>
      <p>Leveling up in a class is the main way a character evolves during a campaign. Some DM's also allow the use of feats to customize a character. Feats are an optional rule in Chapter 6, “Customization Options,” of the Player's Handbook. The DM decides whether they're used and may also decide that some feats are available in a campaign and others aren't.</p>
      <p>This section introduces a collection of special feats that allow you to explore your character's race further. These feats are each associated with a race as summarized in the Racial Feats table. A racial feat represents either a deepening connection to your race's culture or a physical transformation that brings you closer to an aspect of your race's lineage.</p>
      <p>The cause of a particular transformation is up to you and your DM. A transformational feat can symbolize a  latent quality that has emerged as you age, or a transformation might be the result of an event in the campaign, such as exposure to powerful magic or visiting a place of ancient significance to your race. Transformations are a fundamental motif of fantasy literature and folklore. Figuring out why your character has changed can be a rich addition to your campaign's story.</p>

      <p>Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Attribute scores define these qualities – a creature’s assets as well as weaknesses. </p>
      <p>The three main rolls of the game – the attribute check, the saving throw, and the attack roll – rely on the six attribute scores. The book’s introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six attribute scores, and compare the total to a target number. </p>
      <p>This chapter focuses on how to use attribute checks and saving throws, covering the fundamental activities that creatures attempt in the game. Rules for attack rolls appear in chapter 9 of the Player's Handbook.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ABILITY SCORES AND MODIFIERS</p>
      <p>Each of a creature’s attributes has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that attribute. An attribute score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature’s training and competence in activities related to that attribute. </p>
      <p>A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most attributes. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.</p>
      <p>Each attribute also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from −5 (for an attribute score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Attribute Scores and Modifiers table notes the attribute modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.</p>
      <p>To determine an attribute modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the attribute score and then divide the total by 2 (round down). </p>
      <p>Because attribute modifiers affect almost every attack roll, attribute check, and saving throw, attribute modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.</p>

      <p/>
      <p>ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE</p>
      <p>Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you</p>
      <p>have advantage or disadvantage on an attribute check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.</p>
      <p>If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.</p>
      <p>If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.</p>
      <p>When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game lets you reroll or replace the d20, you can reroll or replace only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if you have advantage or disadvantage on an attribute check and roll a 1 and a 13, the character could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1. </p>
      <p>You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Luck can also give a character advantage (as explained in chapter 4, “Personality and Background”). The DM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PROFICIENCY BONUS</p>
      <p>Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level, as detailed in chapter 1. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on attribute checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.</p>
      <p>Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Willpower saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save. </p>
      <p>Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue’s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain attribute checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.</p>
      <p>By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an attribute check that wouldn’t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.</p>
      <p>In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ATTRIBUTE CHECKS</p>
      <p>An attribute check tests a character’s or monster’s innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The DM calls for an attribute check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results. </p>
      <p>For every attribute check, the DM decides which of the six attributes is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.</p>

      <p/>
      <p>To make an attribute check, roll a d20 and add the</p>
      <p>relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the attribute check is a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the DM.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CONTESTS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are</p>
      <p>directly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a  magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal—for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of attribute check, called a contest.</p>
      <p>Both participants in a contest make attribute checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding. </p>
      <p>If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.</p>

      <p/>
      <p>SKILLS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Each attribute covers a broad range of capabilities,</p>
      <p>including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an attribute score, and an individual’s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies appear in the monster’s stat block.)</p>
      <p>For example, an Agility check might reflect a character’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Agility has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Agility checks related to sneaking and hiding. </p>
      <p>The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Endurance.) See an ability’s description in the later sections of this chapter for examples of how to use a skill associated with an attribute.</p>

      <p/>
      <p>Sometimes, the DM might ask for an attribute check using a specific skill—for example, “Make a Willpower (Perception) check.” At other times, a player might ask the DM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to attribute checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.</p>
      <p>For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the Dungeon Master might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, they just makes a Strength check.</p>
      <p>VARIANT: SKILLS WITH DIFFERENT ABILITIES</p>
      <p>Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of attribute check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your DM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your DM might call for an Endurance check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your DM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for an Endurance (Athletics) check.  So if you’re proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Endurance check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your orc warrior uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your DM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Personality.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PASSIVE CHECKS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn’t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the DM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster. </p>
      <p>Here’s how to determine a character’s total for a passive check:</p>
      <p>10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check</p>
      <p>If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a score. </p>
      <p>For example, if a 1st-level character has a Willpower of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Willpower (Perception) score of 14. </p>
      <p>The rules on hiding in the “Agility” section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>WORKING TOGETHER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who’s leading the effort – or the one with the highest ability modifier – an make an attribute check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action (see chapter 9 of the Player's Handbook). </p>
      <p>A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can’t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>GROUP CHECKS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the DM might ask for a group attribute check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren’t.</p>
      <p>To make a group attribute check, everyone in the group makes the attribute check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails. </p>
      <p>Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the DM might call for a group Intelligence (Nature) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>USING EACH ATTRIBUTE</p>
      <p>Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six attributes. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>STRENGTH</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical power.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>STRENGTH CHECKS</p>
      <p>A strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation</p>
      <p>Athletics. Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:</p>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull of a stunt mid-jump.</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.</p>
         </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <p>Other Strength Checks. The DM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>Break free of bonds</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>Push through a tunnel that is too small</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>Tip over a statue</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>Keep a boulder from rolling</p>
         </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <p/>
      <p>ATTACK ROLLS AND DAMAGE</p>
      <p>You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>LIFTING AND CARRYING</p>
      <p>Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.</p>
      <p>    Carrying Capacity. Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don't usually have to worry about it.</p>
      <p>    Push, Drag, or Lift. You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.</p>
      <p>    Size and Strength. Larger creature's can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each category above Medium, double the creature's carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve those weights.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>VARIANT: ENCUMBERENCE</p>
      <p>If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are encumbered, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.</p>
      <p>    If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead heavily encumbered, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on attribute checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Agility, or Endurance.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>AGILITY</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Agility measures your dexterity, reflexes, and balance.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>AGILITY CHECKS</p>
      <p>An Agility check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect this aptitude in certain kinds of Agility checks.</p>
      <p>Acrobatics. Your Agility (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship's deck. The DM might also call for an Agility (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.</p>
      <p>Sleight of Hand. Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make an Agility (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another's pocket.</p>
      <p>Stealth. Make an Agility (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.</p>
      <p>Other Agility Checks. The DM might call for an Agility check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>Steer a chariot around a tight turn</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>Securely tie up a prisoner</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>Wriggle free of bonds</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>Play a stringed instrument</p>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <p>Craft a small or detailed object</p>
         </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <p/>
      <p>ATTACK ROLLS AND DAMAGE</p>
      <p>You add your Agility modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Agility modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier, of if you throw a melee weapon, like a dagger or a hatchet.</p>
      <p>ARMOR CLASS</p>
      <p>Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Agility modifier to your Armor Class, as described in Chapter 6, “Equipment.”</p>
      <p/>
      <p>INITIATIVE</p>
      <p>At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making an Agility check. Initiative determines the order of a creature's turns in combat, as described in Chapter 9, “Combat” in the Player's Handbook.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>ENDURANCE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Endurance measures health, stamina and vital force. </p>
      <p/>
      <p>ENDURANCE CHECKS</p>
      <p>Endurance checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Endurance checks, because it is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. An Endurance check can model your attempt to push beyond the normal limits. A DM might call for an Endurance check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>Hold your breath</p>

      <p>HIT POINTS</p>
      <p>Your Endurance modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Endurance modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.</p>
      <p>    If your Endurance modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Endurance modifier when you reach 4th level and you Endurance modifier increases form a +1 to a +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for the 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you're 7th level and some effect lowers your Endurance score so as to reduce your Endurance modifier by 1, your hit points maximum is reduced by 7.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>INTELLIGENCE</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>INTELLIGENCE CHECKS</p>
      <p>An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.</p>
      <p>Arcana. Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes. </p>
      <p>History. Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.</p>
      <p>    Investigation. When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel chat could cause it so collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p>
      <p>Nature. Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles. </p>
      <p>Religion. Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.</p>
      <p>    Other Intelligence Checks. The DM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>

      <p>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</p>
      <p>Mages and Spellswords use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>WILLPOWER</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Willpower measures your mental toughness and how attuned you are to the magic of the world.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>WILLPOWER CHECKS</p>
      <p>A willpower check might reflect an effort to understand a magical source or to care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Willpower checks.</p>
      <p>Animal Handling. When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the DM might call for a Willpower (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Willpower (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.</p>
      <p>Insight. Your Willpower (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.  </p>
      <p>Medicine. A Willpower (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.</p>
      <p>Perception. Your Willpower (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door. </p>
      <p>Survival. The DM might ask you to make a Willpower (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that kagouti live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards. </p>
      <p>Other Willpower Checks. The DM might call for a Willpower check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow</p>

      <p>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</p>
      <p>Crusaders, Sorcerers, and Wardens use Willpower as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>RESISTING SPELLS</p>
      <p>Willpower is typically the attribute required for saving throws against magical damage. This will be listed in the spell block.</p>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>PERSONALITY</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Personality measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>PERSONALITY CHECKS</p>
      <p>A Personality check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Personality checks.</p>
      <p>    Deception. Your Personality (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.</p>
      <p>    Intimidation. When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the DM might ask you to make a Personality (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a conformation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.</p>
      <p>Performance. Your Personality (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment. </p>
      <p>Persuasion. When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the DM might ask you to make a Personality (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk. </p>
      <p>    Other Personality Checks. The DM might call for a Personality check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following: </p>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <p>Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip.</p>

      <p>OTHER ATTRIBUTES</p>
      <p>
         <p/>There are two other attributes that have unique functions and are not directly tied to a specific skill, </p>
      <p/>
      <p>LUCK</p>
      <p>Adventurers can get Luck points in a variety of ways. Your birthsign or class could contribute to your Luck, as well as praying to the right deity. You can use a Luck point when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check, to increase the roll by 1d6.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SPEED</p>
      <p>Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening. </p>
      <p>Refer to the Player's Handbook for more detailed information on speed.</p>

   <p>PART 3: THE RULES OF MAGIC</p>
   <p>CHAPTER 10: SPELLCASTING</p>
   <sect1 id="Section23">
      <p>Magicka is within every spirit and is the energy within all living things. Magnus, an et'Ada known as the god of magic, was said to be the architect of the mortal plane. As this plane, known as Mundus, was formed, he realized that the et'Ada were sacrificing much of their power in its creation. Many of the lesser et'Ada were vanishing, as their entire aspects were being absorbed into Mundus. Magnus immediately ordered the project be terminated, and left to Aetherius at a great cost. In doing so, he tore a hole in the veil of Oblivion through which the magicka of Aetherius flows into world. The great rift left behind, the sun, is itself known as Magnus. </p>
      <p>Soon after, other et'Ada, who would become known as the Magna Ge, fled with Magnus, leaving behind similar holes which became the stars. This is why the star under which a person is born has such great influence on that persons fortunes and fate.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>CASTING A SPELL</p>
      <p>Refer to the Player's Handbook, chapter 10 for more information regarding spells, cantrips, and rituals. This section will only cover the parts of spellcasting that have been revised or follows different rule sets.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>VARIANT: MAGICKA POINTS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Instead of gaining spell slots to cast your spells, you gain spell points referred to as magicka points. Each spell has a point cost based on its level. The Magicka Cost table summarizes the cost in magicka points from 1st to 9th level. Cantrips don't require spell slots and therefore don't require magicka points.</p>
      <p>You expend a number of magicka points to cast a spell of a given level. You can't reduce your magicka point total to less than 0, and you regain magicka points when you rest, as described in the class description.</p>
      <p>Spells of 6th level and higher are particularly taxing to cast. You use magicka to cast one spell of 6th level or higher, but you can't cast a spell of the same level again until you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p>The number of magicka points you have to spend is based on your class level as a spellcaster, as shown in the Magicka Points column of your class table. Your class level also determines the maximum-level spell you can cast. Even though you might have enough points to cast a spell above this maximum, you can't do so.</p>
      <p>Although this system can be applied to monsters that cast spells using magicka, it isn't recommended that you do so. Tracking spell point expenditures for a monster can be cumbersome, so it is best to find what works best for your method. </p>

      <p>COMPONENTS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>To harness the power of magicka, one must have at least one hand free, and be able to speak or, at least, be able to create a resonating sound. Therefore, all spells require Verbal (V) and Somatic (S) components, as described on page 203 of the Player's Handbook. </p>
      <p>In rare circumstances, a magic user will require Material components (M), but this is usually reserved for exceptionally powerful spells, such as a resurrection spell. It is possible that unique and powerful rituals that mark pivotal moments of a campaign will require special materials. These events could include summoning a powerful Daedric Prince, opening a gateway to another realm, or channeling an aedric blessing to eradicate a harmful disease plaguing Tamriel, It is up to the DM's discretion to make these requirements clear.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</p>
      <p>
         <p/>All mortals of Nirn are born with magicka within themselves. Magicka comprises every spirit, it is the energy of all living things and can be harnessed by anyone who devotes themselves to learning its secrets.</p>
      <p>This innate ability allows all men and mer to cast spells without the need of a spellcasting focus, as they themselves are the spellcasting focus.</p>

                  <p>THE SCHOOLS OF MAGIC</p>

            <row>
               <entry>
                  <p>All spells are categorized into one of six schools of magic. </p>
                  <p>Alteration spells distort the local reality through direct imposition of the mage's will. This School concerns itself with magicka's ability to change, often radically, the structure and composition of any object. Unlike the School of illusion, alteration deals with actual change, not the appearance of it. This includes spells of plysis, water breathing, water walking, lock opening, and personal elemental shields such as flame cloaks. </p>
                  <p>Conjuration spells summon and bind the spirits from Oblivion and Aetherius. Some spells are used to trap souls, conjure or banish Daedra or other creatures, as well as summon bound weapons and armor. </p>
                  <p>Destruction spells splinter material bonds by the direct application of force, typically elemental in nature. This includes damaging spells of flame, frost, shock, and disintegration, as well as magic that drains essence or personal attributes. </p>
                  <p>Illusion spells alter the perception in oneself and in others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusion plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.</p>
                  <p>Mysticism spells are used to alter the nature of magic itself. These effects are as extravagantly dispte as the creation of magical cells to hold a victim's spirit after death, to the manipulation of objects at a distance. The sorcery behind them is veiled in a mystery that goes back to the oldest civilizations.</p>
                  <p>Necromancy spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the energy from another creature, or create the undead.</p>
                  <p>Restoration spells resist damage and restores wholeness by reknitting the damage material. The opposite of destruction, this magic is used to heal, create wards, cure disease and poison, and for physical fortification.</p>

      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p/>
      <p>VARIANT: REGAINING MAGICKA</p>
      <p>If you enjoy games that are fast paced and combat heavy, the characters can regain magicka during short rests, allowing them to cast more spells each day. </p>
      <p>You regain magicka when you complete a short rest equal to twice your spellcasting attribute modifier (intelligence, willpower, or personality) while resting.  Sorcerer's, due their stunted magicka feature, are unable to regain magicka during a short rest.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>VARIANT: LEARNING SPELLS</p>
      <p>Instead of learning spells as you level, you can make the world more immersive by requiring to learn spells through study and focus. This creates a lot of downtime activities, which can slow down play, as learning new spells is time consuming. It also makes character's who rely on spells feel weaker early on, as collecting an arsenal of spells will take considerable time.</p>
      <p>Magic is learned and mastered through studying and practice. For some races, like the Altmer, magicka flows through their bloodlines and they live in a culture that embraces the study of magic. Others, like the Nords, are typically cautious to magic's destructive side. Regardless, they all have magicka within, even if they choose not to learn how to use it.</p>
      <p>Classes that use magic, and some races, begin with a set number of known spells. Each time a character reaches a new level in spellcasting, they learn an additional spell, as noted in their class description. Any additional spells must be studied from trainers, usually found colleges and guild halls, or by studying spell books.</p>
      <p>Spells can be learned much faster from spell trainers than from studying spell books, but trainers can be costly. A spell learned from a trainer requires 4 hours of study and 50 septims per spell level, beginning with Cantrips. For example, a 1st level spell requires 8 hours and 100 septims, and a 7th level spell requires 32 hours of training and 400 septims. </p>
      <p>You can study from a trainer up to 8 hours a day. To determine how much knowledge has been retained, roll a die equal to the hours studied (1d8) and add the character's Intelligence modifier. Studying from a book requires twice as much time, but spell books can be found while adventuring, but they can sometimes be purchased from guild halls for half the cost of training.</p>

      <p>SPELLCRAFTING</p>
      <p>
         <p/>Talented mages are capable of crafting spells, either through trial and error, or with the aid of a master. Spellcrafting Altars can be found in most universities and colleges where the imagination and innate talent is the only restriction. </p>
      <p>    The creation of a spell has the same cost as training in a spell of equal skill level, usually spent on rare inks and component, but the process takes twice as long since constant practice is required to create something unique. The spellcrafter must know the effects from another spell to create a spell that uses a similar effect. To create a spell, work with your Dungeon Master and use the guidelines presented in the Dungeon Master's Guide.</p>
      <p>REDUCING SPELLCRAFTING TIME</p>
      <p>Once each day, when a spellcaster spends time researching a spell they are crafting, they are required to make a Spellcrafting Check. This check is treated as though you are casting a spell with your spell attack modifier.  The DC of this check is equal to 10 + the level of the spell being created. </p>
      <p>    On a successful check, the crafter can roll an additional die, equal to the time spent researching, to reduce the total remaining time. No time is reduced on an unsuccessful check, however, a critical failure and a critical success both reduce the time by twice the normal amount. We often learn more from our mistakes than from minor successes, and this is reflected in spell creation.</p>
