			<p class="flavor">Imperials are the well educated and civilized men of the cosmopolitan province of Cyrodiil. Although not as physically impressive as some of the other races, the Imperials have a confident authority about them that they have been able to use to their advantage with the surrounding nations.</p>
			<h4>FROM SLAVE TO MASTER</h4>
			<p>When the Imperial race emerged from the original Nibenese tribesman and the Nedic immigrants, they were subjugated by the Ayleids, or Wild Elves of Cyrodiil. They remained as slaves for decades before creating a rebellion that overthrew their elven masters, creating the first human empire. Although short lived, this early empire was disrupted through civil war, splitting Cyrodiil into two distinct cultures: the Eastern Nibenese and the Western Colovians. Since then, the Imperials and their ever changing Empire have had some part in the birth of each Era.</p>
			<h4>DIPLOMATS AND SOLDIERS</h4>
			<p>Known for their impressive citizen armies, the Imperials are exceptionally disciplined and treat the law with the utmost respect. Banners of the Imperial Empire can be found in nearly every province of Tamriel, although recent years have proven to be a struggle to maintain their power.</p>
			<p class="indent">As shrewd diplomats and remarkable negotiators, the Imperials have had great success subduing other nations, bringing peace and prosperity to many societies. When their authority is questioned, their martial prowess and extraordinary organization of their military usually makes quick work of any dissenters.</p>
			<h4>IMPERIAL NAMES</h4>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> As a human race, Imperials live to an average age of 100.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> The militant Imperials are often lawful good, but sometimes lean towards neutral, given their stringent laws and institutions.</p>

You can wait until after you roll the d20 before deciding to use the Luck Dice, but must decide before the DM determines whether the roll succeeds or fails.</p>
			<p class="indent">You regain your expended Luck Dice when you finish a long rest. You can never have more than two Luck Dice from this trait at a time.</p>
