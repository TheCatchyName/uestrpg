		<description>
			<p class="flavor">The manmer, or half elves, of High Rock are known as Bretons. They are the descendants of Aldmeri rulers and Nedic slaves, who eventually came to rule over the feudal society.</p>
			<h4>COUPLED LINEAGE</h4>
			<p>Bretons are sometimes referred to as the mongrel race of Tamriel, being neither elven, nor truly human. Sometimes, although usually only in a derogative manner, the Bretons are called Manmeri, literally 'man-elf', due to their history of crossbreeding.</p>
			<p class="indent">Their physical appearance is similar to their Nedic ancestors, giving them pale skin tones comparable to their Nord and Imperial cousins, along with the same range of hair color. Similar to the high elves, they maintain a slender form. This elven bloodline ensures that they are never quite as muscular as the other human races. A keen observer can also notice subtle elven lineaments, especially from their eyebrows, Â slightly pointed ears, and high cheekbones. Some bretons even seem to adopt their elven arrogance, but paired with their human emotions, it usually comes off more graceful.</p>
			<h4>CURIOUS AND INQUISITIVE</h4>
			<p>Although their Aldmeri ancestry is diluted, which shows in their physical appearance, they remain as capable mages with a strong resistance to magic. They are intellectual purists, known for their aptitude in abstract thinking, and are naturally drawn towards careers that favor logic and ordered complexity.</p>
			<p class="indent">Bretons are known to be skilled in many fields. Their friendly spirits and humorous demeanor lend themselves to writing, acting, and artistry. Their love of commerce leads them into banking, manufacturing, and trading, while their desire for order makes them well suited for the military and sailing.</p>
			<h4>A STRUGGLE FOR SOVEREIGNTY</h4>
			<p>Breton society is divided into the the many different regions of High Rock. The feudal kingdoms compete for power and enforce the strict hierarchy that splits its people from peasants and the elite. Despite this obvious rivalry, the bretons are united in their culture, accents, customs and language. Their villages are quaint, and although the architecture may change between the districts, they are usually functional in style and free of ornamentation.</p>
			<p class="indent">Bretons compete with the orsimer, with their great city of orsinium and the many small orcish strongholds, as well as the barbaric reachmen.</p>
			<h4>BORN FOR ADVENTURE</h4>
			<p>Performing quests and services is a common way for bretons to rise in the ranks of their society, which has created a unique form of enthusiasm. The younger bretons are raised with a desire to find fortune and glory all over Tamriel.</p>
			<h4>EXCELLENT AMBASSADORS</h4>
			<p>Many Bretons learn at an early age to get along with everyone, defusing hostility and finding common ground. As a race, they have elven grace without elven aloofness and human energy without human boorishness. They often make excellent ambassadors and go-betweens.</p>
			<h4>BRETON NAMES</h4>
