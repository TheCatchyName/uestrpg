		<description>
			<p>A tall nord tribesman strides through a blizzard, draped in fur and hefting his axe. He laughs as he charges toward the giant who dared poach his people’s elk herd. </p>
      		<p class="indent">An orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.</p>
      		<p class="indent">Frothing at the mouth, a redguard slams his helmet into the face of his dunmer foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.</p>
      		<p class="indent">These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.</p>
      		<p class="indent">For some, their rage springs from a connection with ancient traditions. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger from memories of past battles. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength. </p>
			<h4>PRIMAL INSTINCT</h4>
			<p>People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one’s own nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt.</p>
			<p class="indent">Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.</p>
			<h4>A LIFE OF DANGER</h4>
			<p>Not every member of the tribes deemed “barbarians” by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don’t have to.</p>
			<p class="indent">Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A BARBARIAN</h4>
			<p>When creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant land, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where barbarians are common?</p>
			<p class="indent">What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to “civilized” lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>

		<supports>Primal Path</supports>
		<description>
			<p>The Path of the War Crier is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian learns to channel their life essence through their voice and breath. War Criers are rare in barbarian tribes, but those who have the gift are usually put into positions of power, either as shaman, spiritual leaders, or chieftains.</p>
			<p class="indent">Most nords have some innate capacity for the power of the voice, believing that their breath holds their vital essence. The other races can learn how to wield such power, but may require greater study, perhaps spending time with powerful Tongues.</p>

		<description>
			<p>When you choose this path at 3rd level, you learn how to harness the power of the dragon tongue to form powerful shouts. A shout requires you to spend shout points each time you use it.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Shouts.</em></strong> You know the Unrelenting Force shout and one other shout of your choice, which are detailed in the “Dragon Shouts” section below. You learn two additional shouts of your choice at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you learn a new shout, you can also replace one shout that you already know with a different shout.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Shouts Points.</em></strong> You have 2 shout points and you regain any expended shout points when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain two additional shout points at 6th level (4), and again at 10th level (6), and 14th level (8).</p>
      		<p class="indent"><strong><em>Using Words of Power.</em></strong> The Thu'um is a form of magic which uses words from the draconic language to form powerful shouts to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don't need to use any magicka to cast it.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional shout points to increase the level of a Battle Shout spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as unrelenting force does. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional shout point you spend.</p>
			<p class="indent">The maximum number of shout points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base shout cost and any additional shout points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your barbarian level, as shown in the Spells and Shout Points table.</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>Barbarian Level</td><td>Maximum Shout Points for a Spell</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>5th-8th</td><td>3</td></tr>
				<tr><td>9th-12th</td><td>4</td></tr>
				<tr><td>13th-16th</td><td>5</td></tr>
				<tr><td>17th-20th</td><td>6</td></tr>

			Some of your Battle Thum features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:			
			<center>
				<p><strong>Battle Thu'um Save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Endurance modifier</p>
