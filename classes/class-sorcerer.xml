        <description>
			<p>Golden eyes flashing, an altmer stretches out her hand and unleashes the fire that burns in her veins. As an inferno rages around her foes, her eyes turn black from the daedric influence powering her magic.</p>
            <p class="indent">Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, a breton spreads his arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting him momentarily off the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, through him, and out from him in a mighty blast of lightning.</p>
            <p class="indent">Crouching behind a stalagmite, an argonian points a finger at a charging falmer. A blast of fire springs from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back behind the rock formation with a grin. </p>
            <p class="indent">Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One can’t study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer. </p>
			<h4>RAW MAGIC</h4>
			<p>Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline, while others have made a dangerous pact with powerful beings to grant them unimaginable power. </p>
            <p class="indent">The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some ancestries produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear from the alignment of the stars. Some sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a daedra or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity, exposure to the elemental forces of the Mundus or the maddening chaos of Oblivion.</p>
            <p class="indent">Sorcerers don't rely on spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore the way that mages do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.</p>
			<h4>UNEXPLAINED POWERS</h4>
			<p>Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it’s unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn’t like to stay quiet. A sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded.</p>
            <p class="indent">Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party as mages, making up for a comptive lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous capacity and power in using the spells they know.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A SORCERER</h4>
			<p>The most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the focus of your power. As a starting character, you'll choose a focus that ties to either your ancestry, your birthright, an unexpected event, or to daedric influence, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well? </p>
            <p class="indent">How do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its nature? Is it a blessing or a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you’ve been given this power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you the right to do what you want, to take what you want from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful individual in the world – the deity that blessed you at birth or the daedra who chose you to carry this power.</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a sorcerer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Willpower should be your highest attribute score, followed by Endurance. Second, choose the hermit background. Third, choose the light, prestidigitation, ray of frost, and shocking grasp cantrips, along with the 1st level spells shield and magic missile.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You were born with innate magical potential, drawing on a nearly endless font of magicka. This natural gift allows you cast spells.</p>
			<h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
			<p>At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.</p>
			<h5>MAGICKA</h5>
			<p>The Sorcerer table shows how much magicka you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend magicka, as noted in the spell's description and the Magicka Cost table.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and are able to cast 2nd-level spells, you can cast burning hands at either level.</p>
			<h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
			<p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you can cast, as shown on the table's Spell Level column for your level. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you can cast.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING ATTRIBUTE</h5>
			<p>Willpower is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells. You use your Willpower whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Willpower modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Willpower modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Willpower modifier</p>

		<description>
			<p>Necromancers are sorcerers who have dedicated themselves to The Black Arts. They utilize the enslavement of involuntary souls and their bodies.</p>
      		<p class="indent">These dark sorcerers focus on the ability to manipulate the energies that animate all living things. Through an understanding of the thin lines between life, death, and undeath, they sap the life force from creatures, distorting the vital energy, and transforming it into magical power that they can manipulate.</p>
      		<p class="indent">Necromancy has been banned in some provinces and the practice is widely debated throughout Nirn. Most people see necromancers as menacing, or even villainous, due to the close association with death. Not all necromancers are evil, but the forces they manipulate are considered taboo by many.</p>
