			<p>You shout in an attempt to freeze a target that you can see that is within 60 feet of you.</p>
			<p class="indent">The target must make a Strength saving throw to resist the spell. On a failed save, the target takes 4d8 cold damage and they are encased in a shell of frost.

If it successfully saves against the shout three times, the effect ends. If it fails its save three times, the frost hardens and the creature is subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.</p>

			<p><em>Strun Bah Qo</em> | 3 Shout Points</p>
			<p>Your shout riles up a storm, as clouds appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see 100 feet directly above you. The shout fails if you can’t see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can’t accommodate the cloud). When you use this shout, choose a point you can see within range. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make an Agility saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the effect ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one. If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell’s damage increases by 1d10.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> The damage increases by 1d10 for each additional shout point spent.</p>
